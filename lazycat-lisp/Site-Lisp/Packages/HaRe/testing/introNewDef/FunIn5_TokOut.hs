module FunIn5 where

--A new definition can be introduced to denote an identified sub-expression.
--The newly introduced definition may be a function binding
--or a simple constant binding. The new binding will be put at the end of the 
--local 'where' or 'let' clause depending on the scope of high lighted source.

--In this example: Introduce a new definition to denote 'z*w'
--this example aims to test that every occurrence of the idenified
--sub-expression in the rhs will be folded.
