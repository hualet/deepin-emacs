
{- Refactoring: move the definiton 'fringe' to module C1. This example aims
   to test the moving of the definition and the modification of export/import -}

module D1(sumSquares) where

import C1


   
sumSquares (x:xs) = sq x + sumSquares xs
sumSquares [] = 0
   
sq x = x ^pow 

pow = 2
