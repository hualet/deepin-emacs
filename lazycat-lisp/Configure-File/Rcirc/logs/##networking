2008-11-02 12:20 artagnon         Hi. I purchased some space at DreamHost and created myself an FTP/SSH account
2008-11-02 12:20 Yo               I'm having a problem... I have an embedded server running OpenWRT (linux) with a VPN client connected to my University network at the same time it's serving the service by WIFI (Ap Mode) with DNSMask service running the problem is that all the clients which sends dns requests instead of resolve my openwrt server are sends throught the tunnel too :S
2008-11-02 12:20 Yo               it has no sense for me
2008-11-02 12:22 artagnon         but when I FTP and try to 'rm', I get 501: Not Implemented
2008-11-02 12:22 chalco           artagnon, try sftp instead

2008-11-08 22:34 apinunt          x86: Do I have to make changes in both the modem and the router? The router had been working connected to a satellite modem connected to the WAN port previously, and now I have ADSL service but cannot access the ADSL modem through the routers WAN port.
2008-11-08 22:35 x86              well if the modem is acting as a router, it's taking your external IP from your ISP
2008-11-08 22:35 x86              and giving your router an internal IP
2008-11-08 22:36 x86              (probably on the same subnet your router has on it's LAN interfaces, which is certainly not going to work)
2008-11-08 22:36 x86              in bridge mode, you should be able to pass through the external IP that your ISP gives you to your router on the WAN interface
2008-11-08 22:41 apinunt          x86: The modem receives a dynamic address from the ISP, and I have the modems IP address set to 192.168.1.2, instead of the default 192.168.1.1 which is the routers IP, and each computer has a static address assigned, 192.168.1.xxx. I set the TCP/IP gateway in each computer to 192.168.1.1 and the DNS also to 192.168.1.1 when trying to connect through the router to the modem, but cannot even...
2008-11-08 22:41 apinunt          ...ping 192.168.1.2 when I do so.
2008-11-08 22:42 x86              yeah that wont work
2008-11-08 22:42 x86              you've got the same network (192.168.1.0/24) on both the WAN and LAN of the router
2008-11-08 22:42 apinunt          x86: But that is essentially what was set up and working when I had satellite service.
2008-11-08 22:44 x86              doubt it
2008-11-08 22:50 apinunt          x86: I just looked back at some old notes, and I think you're right. It looks like the satellite was using 192.168.0.1 and the router was set to 192.168.1.1
2008-11-08 22:50 apinunt          Should I be able to set the ADSL modem to 192.168.0.1?
2008-11-08 22:55 apinunt          x86: If I am beginning to understand correctly, does this mean that between the computers and the router is like one network, and between the router and the ADSL is like another network, and both can't use 192.168.1 as their base address?
2008-11-08 23:00 apinunt          x86: If you're still around, I have one additional question to ask, assuming I am making progress in my understanding.

2008-11-11 09:47 dsdf             hello
2008-11-11 09:48 dsdf             I've a question.....
2008-11-11 09:51 dsdf             my scenario is a wired network and some wireless AP  on different places with some clients on each one.... my question is, just sniffing in one of those clients ( by ethereal or whatever) I'm going to get the pockets of everybody or just from the clients of my AP?
2008-11-11 09:51 dsdf             and why...
2008-11-11 09:51 chalco           the clients of the AP + broadcast traffic
2008-11-11 09:52 chalco           the AP will only forward traffic destined to a wireless client, or a broadcast
2008-11-11 09:52 Spo0nz           /join 
2008-11-11 09:54 dsdf             ok right.... and if the client which is sniffing is connected directly on the wired network, in promiscuous mode... will it get all the packets of the network?
2008-11-11 09:54 dsdf             I meant... the promiscuous mode in a wired network is just for sniff the clients conected to a switch or everybody?
2008-11-11 09:56 Spo0nz           /quit Client Quit
2008-11-11 09:56 chalco           a switch will only forward broadcasts and any packets destined for that host
2008-11-11 09:56 chalco           (on a given port)
2008-11-11 09:57 jeev             sup chalco
2008-11-11 09:57 chalco           hello
2008-11-11 09:58 jeev             othing
2008-11-11 09:58 jeev             nothing much, getting quote from cable co
2008-11-11 09:58 jeev             they tell me that it's all their equipment
2008-11-11 09:58 jeev             and their routes are transparent
2008-11-11 09:58 dsdf             aha... so promiscuous mode on wired networks is only useful and will be able to collect only the packets conected to a hub and broadcast, right?
2008-11-11 09:58 jeev             so i'll just need a server, they'll even provide a media converter lol
2008-11-11 09:59 chalco           I see
2008-11-11 09:59 chalco           dsdf, correct
2008-11-11 09:59 jeev             they're checking prices on lower commit.
2008-11-11 09:59 jeev             but for gig PTP, they think it's 4k, possibly less
2008-11-11 09:59 chalco           dsdf, you will still see all traffic coming to that node
2008-11-11 09:59 jeev             and they may even cover buildout
2008-11-11 10:00 d3               /join 
2008-11-11 10:01 dsdf             so, for example.... if I have a switch and some clients connected to that switch, if someone is sniffing, will it see all packets or only broadcast and its own packets? :| that what it doesn't make sense
2008-11-11 10:01 chalco           only broadcast and its own packets
2008-11-11 10:01 dsdf             ok, I undestand now.... :)
2008-11-11 10:01 jeev             chalco, i hope they give me a low low low price for the 50mbit commit for PTP
2008-11-11 10:02 jeev             my god that'd be awesome to start with
2008-11-11 10:02 chalco           I'm sure you do hope that
2008-11-11 10:02 jeev             chalco, is it legal to start selling wimax like airband.com ?
2008-11-11 10:02 jeev             ahaa

2008-11-11 10:02 dsdf             chalco,  thank you
2008-11-11 10:03 chalco           jeev, as far as I know. you might need spectrum licenses
2008-11-11 10:03 jeev             mhmm
2008-11-11 10:04 jeev             i'd do QoS and let my clients burst as much as they wanted
2008-11-11 10:05 jeev             but it's too much to say that they can't use limewire and crap, right?
2008-11-11 10:05 chalco           with all due respect, you don't know how to order a PtP link, and you are going to start an ISP?
2008-11-11 10:05 jeev             i do know
2008-11-11 10:05 jeev             i was confused
2008-11-11 10:05 jeev             some turd told me the wrong terminology

2008-11-11 10:12 Sargun_Screen    For your ISP?
2008-11-11 10:12 jeev             i'm gonna fund it myself
2008-11-11 10:13 jeev             i have nobody to pay
2008-11-11 10:13 Sargun_Screen    Are you in the US?
2008-11-11 10:13 chalco           I worked for someone that did
2008-11-11 10:13 jeev             Sargun_Screen, i'm gonna just outfit a building withj fiber and let htem buy service from me
2008-11-11 10:13 jeev             yea
2008-11-11 10:13 chalco           *did that

2008-11-11 10:13 jeev             chalco, successful?
2008-11-11 10:13 jeev             succesful ?
2008-11-11 10:13 chalco           it failed both times
2008-11-11 10:13 jeev             damn
2008-11-11 10:13 jeev             what did he try
2008-11-11 10:13 jeev             i want to get the tenants in the building to commit to it
2008-11-11 10:13 jeev             see if it meets theeir expectations
2008-11-11 10:13 jeev             i'm not planning wimax really
2008-11-11 10:13 jeev             until i perfect the building
2008-11-11 10:14 Sargun_Screen    Are you in the US?
2008-11-11 10:14 jeev             there is a single office with 4 t1's
2008-11-11 10:14 jeev             just internet
2008-11-11 10:14 jeev             yes.
2008-11-11 10:14 jeev             i am in the US
2008-11-11 10:14 Sargun_Screen    Where in the US?
2008-11-11 10:14 jeev             so they pay i think 2k, cause they're overpaying
2008-11-11 10:14 jeev             los angeles
2008-11-11 10:14 Sargun_Screen    Yeah..
2008-11-11 10:14 jeev             so i could bring a loop in there, offer them same price for 20mbit i guess
2008-11-11 10:14 Sargun_Screen    Yeah, you're the same guy....
2008-11-11 10:15 jeev             BGP ?
2008-11-11 10:15 jeev             i've never tried bgp over sbc
2008-11-11 10:15 jeev             heh
2008-11-11 10:15 Sargun_Screen    No, no. you were trying to do something eccentric
2008-11-11 10:16 chalco           buying a PtP fiber link isn't that eccentric
2008-11-11 10:16 Sargun_Screen    chalco: He was trying to use a block of IPs he had 'purchased' from another provider
2008-11-11 10:16 chalco           not when I spoke to him, at least

2008-11-11 10:17 jeev             hold up
2008-11-11 10:17 jeev             that wasn't me dood
2008-11-11 10:17 jeev             when was this?
2008-11-11 10:17 jeev             i've been on freenode like a few months

2008-11-11 10:19 ktwilight        /quit Remote closed the connection
2008-11-11 10:19 jeev             and there is someone upstairs that alone pays 2k.
2008-11-11 10:19 jeev             so if i can commit a small commit at 1k/month
2008-11-11 10:19 jeev             and bandwidth..
2008-11-11 10:19 jeev             i can cover that and profit off rest.
2008-11-11 10:20 Sargun_Screen    wait, are you also jeeves?
2008-11-11 10:20 jeev             no
2008-11-11 10:20 jeev             damnit
2008-11-11 10:20 jeev             and plus, i already have a cage.. and shit at the datacenter
2008-11-11 10:20 jeev             my cost is bandwidth and ptp
2008-11-11 10:21 Sargun_Screen    what DC?
2008-11-11 10:21 jeev             one wilshire
2008-11-11 10:21 Sargun_Screen    Oh, neat.
2008-11-11 10:21 jeev             yes.
2008-11-11 10:21 jeev             tell me if i'm thinking wrong.
2008-11-11 10:21 jeev             a) get pricing for PTP, including install, build out.. blablhahlab
2008-11-11 10:22 jeev             b) i alreayde have bandwidth pricing.
2008-11-11 10:22 jeev             c) price out my two routers. point A and B.
2008-11-11 10:22 jeev             i'm gonna use linux or bsd.
2008-11-11 10:22 jeev             simple shit.
2008-11-11 10:22 jeev             i'll probably sell $30/mbit to the tenants, they'll like it cause it's symmetrical
2008-11-11 10:22 Sargun_Screen    well, once you get IP to the building
2008-11-11 10:22 jeev             and i'll also offer off site storage
2008-11-11 10:22 Sargun_Screen    most people don't care if it is symmetrical
2008-11-11 10:22 jeev             ahh
2008-11-11 10:23 Sargun_Screen    $30/mbit, why would they pay that?
2008-11-11 10:23 jeev             they want it man, people are yearning to tell ATT to fuck off
2008-11-11 10:23 jeev             because, they're smart people here. they will pay it
2008-11-11 10:23 jeev             for dedicated access?
2008-11-11 10:23 Sargun_Screen    you can get oversubscribed T DSL for $12.95/Mbit/sec
2008-11-11 10:23 jeev             multihomed dedicated internet
2008-11-11 10:23 jeev             i'll also let them put their server at the datacenter for a fee, use as off site.
2008-11-11 10:23 jeev             and pay cost+5 for loop.
2008-11-11 10:23 jeev             simple as that.
2008-11-11 10:24 Sargun_Screen    How many people have a server?
2008-11-11 10:24 jeev             cheap off site back up managed by the company
2008-11-11 10:24 Sargun_Screen    that they want offsite?
2008-11-11 10:24 jeev             it's a big company upstairs
2008-11-11 10:24 jeev             they have two floors and like 200 people
2008-11-11 10:24 jeev             i'm sure
2008-11-11 10:24 jeev             they have off site back up
2008-11-11 10:25 jeev             why not secure it themselves at a cheap price
2008-11-11 10:25 jeev             am i wrong or am i wrong
2008-11-11 10:26 jeev             i could easily offer them 100mbit for 3k, dedicated
2008-11-11 10:26 jeev             they'd take it
2008-11-11 10:26 jeev             i'll guarantee it.
2008-11-11 10:27 jeev             i just think the building is too small ;/

2008-11-11 17:08 biatche          Anybody familiar with Dual NICs? I have a Intel PRO/1000 MT Server Adapter (PWLA8492MT). When I use DHCP, it gets weird different ips like 169.x.x.x when it should be 192.168.0.x.. I'm able to detect the mac address of the nics, but, hmm, nothing seems to be working. I don't even know where to begin.

2008-11-11 18:12 iascorga         is your password weak?
2008-11-11 18:13 doublehp         from logs (i log everything), it's the first attempt against my user; 99,999999% attemps are against non existing users (root, admin, mail ... ). That day, Gaoland attacks my user "dhp", and get it firs shot. I am really surprised.

2008-11-11 18:31 Ficthe           doublehp, my modem feeds the connection to my wrt54gl router - and suppose each of the 4 machines feeding of it have port 80 open.. well,  this assignment of public ip to a machine you speak of, this is probably something to be set on the router's settings page?

2008-11-12 09:53 cherrytop        Yeah
2008-11-12 09:53 Hfuy             try netstat /b, which should list the programs which opened the ports.
2008-11-12 09:55 cherrytop        Yeah, they're all suspicious processes, but I don't understand why they're all zeros instead of a specific address?
2008-11-12 09:55 Hfuy             Haven't the foggiest
2008-11-12 09:55 chalco           0.0.0.0 means all addresses
2008-11-12 09:56 Hfuy             I was about to say, isn' 0.0.0.0 the broadcast address
2008-11-12 09:56 chalco           and 135 isn't suspicious, it's windows filesharing
2008-11-12 09:56 chalco           no, 255.255.255.255 is the broadcast address
2008-11-12 09:56 Hfuy             I don't know. Listen to chalco.
2008-11-12 09:57 cherrytop        So it's listening on all addresses for connections from all addresses?
2008-11-12 09:57 kidem            /join 
2008-11-12 09:57 cherrytop        And when it makes a connection, a netstat should show the real source and destination, correct?
2008-11-12 09:57 chalco           correct
2008-11-12 09:58 cherrytop        Thanks!

2008-11-12 10:10 chalco           might be a firewall or something that decrements TTL, but doesn't route?

2008-11-17 11:05 Xedecimal        anyone here familiar with an actiontec router, most specifically the verizon fios actiontec router
2008-11-17 11:07 Xedecimal        when I'm adding a network protocol, it whines when I have two designated 'Any' tcp destinations... Yet if I have 500 'Any' source designations, it could care less, should I be using only destination or source? I was thinking that incoming port 80 would suggest a local webserver, and outgoing port 80 would suggest a local web browser right?
2008-11-17 11:08 Xedecimal        and now that I'm sending information over port 6667 or whichever port this irc server is on, it seems as though qos is limiting ALL my network activity, because it falls under a low priority rule, is this how it is supposed to work? I was hoping to set QoS on only specific protocol activity, not ip based
2008-11-17 11:11 viaSanctus       and in which case should you base it on ip?
2008-11-17 11:11 Xedecimal        I can't think of any reason to base it on ip myself, but I do see what you're getting at, it's not limiting a specific ip for using a protocol that is deemed unworthy ?
2008-11-17 11:12 Xedecimal        actually, I can, if you have a 14 year old in the house that likes to download viruses, that like to lag your network, chances are, you want to limit that ip
2008-11-17 11:12 Xedecimal        a cheap hacky fix, but it would work

2008-11-17 11:15 Xedecimal        geez, I think I get it now
2008-11-17 11:16 Xedecimal        if I were to configure it that way, I would be configuring a qos rule for a dns server that does not exist here
2008-11-17 11:16 Xedecimal        whether outgoing or incoming, it's almost always going to be the destination that defines the protocol
2008-11-17 11:17 Xedecimal        I think that sorts out all my qos woes, and your suggestion rules out my paranoia, lol

2008-11-17 11:44 viaSanctus       lease dedicated bandwith?
2008-11-17 11:44 viaSanctus       (pre vpn best practice)

2008-11-17 11:46 diegoviola       viaSanctus: pre vpn?
2008-11-17 11:46 viaSanctus       well yeah companies used to lease dedicated lines to connect offices
2008-11-17 11:46 viaSanctus       but then vpn came..
2008-11-17 11:46 diegoviola       other people was recommending me tier-1 connections between the two continents
2008-11-17 11:46 viaSanctus       its much cheaper
2008-11-17 11:47 Sargun           uhm
2008-11-17 11:47 Sargun           no.
2008-11-17 11:47 diegoviola       how vpn will help with the bandwidth?
2008-11-17 11:47 Sargun           just get huge jitter buffers
2008-11-17 11:47 viaSanctus       wasnt the solution diego
2008-11-17 11:48 viaSanctus       and tier 1...
2008-11-17 11:48 Sargun           how much $ do you have?
2008-11-17 11:49 viaSanctus       isnt that to avoind paying for data-load
2008-11-17 11:49 viaSanctus       i dont know if that will gain you speed by using their network
2008-11-17 11:49 viaSanctus       a leased dedicated line will be the fastest afaik

2008-11-17 12:16 diegoviola       i need some kind of conference platform that interacts with the pstn
2008-11-17 12:17 diegoviola       and sip-to-sip calls too
2008-11-17 12:17 diegoviola       the protocol doens't matter really, it only have to be good in quality
2008-11-17 12:17 diegoviola       thats why i chose freeswitch but it sucks on the public internet
2008-11-17 12:17 diegoviola       i started with asterisk but that was buggy as hell as well
2008-11-17 12:18 Sargun           when was that
2008-11-17 12:18 diegoviola       what?
2008-11-17 12:19 diegoviola       when was what?
2008-11-17 12:19 viaSanctus       diegoviola, i use their client
2008-11-17 12:19 viaSanctus       for skype i wrote my own, but didnt like their network much
2008-11-17 12:20 viaSanctus       and i never used it with more than 1 participant in a phone call (if you mean that)
2008-11-17 12:20 viaSanctus       and yes you can call fixed phone lines
2008-11-17 12:20 diegoviola       Sargun: when i tried asterisk and found buggy?
2008-11-17 12:20 viaSanctus       at very cheap rates even
2008-11-17 12:20 Sargun           how long ago was that?
2008-11-17 12:20 diegoviola       Sargun: 5 months ago
2008-11-17 12:21 viaSanctus       i tried to have a conference with skype with muliple participants once, only one could react, the others could listen only
2008-11-17 12:21 Sargun           odd.
2008-11-17 12:21 Sargun           I've been running asterisk alright
2008-11-17 12:21 Sargun           for many years
2008-11-17 12:22 viaSanctus       if your boss is willing to invest
2008-11-17 12:22 viaSanctus       i'm planning to develop a new unified messaging system
2008-11-17 12:22 viaSanctus       not with asterisk libs though
2008-11-17 12:22 viaSanctus       brekeke sounds promising
2008-11-17 12:22 diegoviola       Sargun: i had dtmf issues (but this was probably because of packet loss), i had this with freeswitch too... and some sound issues but this is probably because of the network as well, although i didn't had this with FS
2008-11-17 12:22 diegoviola       Sargun: and what pissed me off is that i needed the ztdummy module that was a pain to install on XEN
2008-11-17 12:23 diegoviola       asterisk is fine
2008-11-17 12:23 viaSanctus       brekeke offers alot for the .net platform
2008-11-17 12:23 diegoviola       its just the bandwidth the problem i have
2008-11-17 12:23 viaSanctus       well its nice to have a callers id pop up on your pc screen, with all info on him from your company's db
2008-11-17 12:24 viaSanctus       record his message, invite quiet participants..that sort of stuff
2008-11-17 12:24 Sargun           diegoviola, I had Asterisk installed on Xen in like 20 minutes

2008-11-17 12:31 diegoviola       Sargun: try freeswitch, it makes it easier as the mod_conference doesn't depend on any external module

2008-11-17 12:32 Sargun           ping6 ipv6.google.com
2008-11-17 12:32 Sargun           what does that say?

2008-11-17 12:32 Sargun           make a mtr -6

2008-11-17 12:33 Sargun           diegoviola, yes ma'am.
2008-11-17 12:33 Sebboh           what's an MTR -6?
2008-11-17 12:33 diegoviola       Sargun: but not between multiples continents i guess
2008-11-17 12:33 Sargun           diegoviola, no..
2008-11-17 12:33 Sargun           Sebboh, install MTR, apt-get install mtr
2008-11-17 12:33 Sargun           then do mtr -6 www.kame.net
2008-11-17 12:34 diegoviola       i can have asterisk/freeswitch or anything else running fine on public internet too, but the problem is between multiples continents
2008-11-17 12:34 diegoviola       the delay
2008-11-17 12:34 diegoviola       it piss me off
2008-11-17 12:35 Sebboh           my ISP's DNS servers have been giving me AAAA records for all kindsa junk for almost a year, but normally I fail to connect to them (of course) so usually I disable ipv6 on all my boxen.. This one is new.. so I didn't.. and it .. seems to work..  Dude I must be using a tunnel or something because there's no way my netgear router supports ipv6. =P
2008-11-17 12:35 Sebboh           It does need to, doesn't it?
2008-11-17 12:36 Sargun           Sebboh, who is your isp
2008-11-17 12:37 Sargun           Sebboh, what is your ipv6 address
2008-11-17 12:37 Sebboh           Sargun: mtr is just traceroute6, right?  here's the output of traceroute6 www.kame.net

2008-11-17 12:40 Sebboh           I started unplugging cables and I lost IPv6..
2008-11-17 12:42 Sargun           o.O
2008-11-17 12:42 Sargun           unplugging cables tends to do that
2008-11-17 12:42 Sebboh           Well I unplugged everything that wasn't my local ISP. :)
2008-11-17 12:42 diegoviola       how do you avoid packet loss and shit like that for having a good voip system... between continents
2008-11-17 12:42 diegoviola       impossible, right?
2008-11-17 12:43 viaSanctus       diegoviola, if you really depend so much on IP telephony, create your own protocol
2008-11-17 12:43 Sebboh           diegoviola: try your existing technology with a faster connection.  It's 2008.
2008-11-17 12:43 diegoviola       viaSanctus: why a new protocol?
2008-11-17 12:44 viaSanctus       "avoind packet loss" --> create a protocol that makes sure you don't have that
2008-11-17 12:44 viaSanctus       have a fast enough line and bare with a couple of milisecs delay
2008-11-17 12:44 viaSanctus       you'll have 0% package loss
2008-11-17 12:44 diegoviola       like the "avoiding deadlock" in asterisk?
2008-11-17 12:45 viaSanctus       thats why the own protocol

2008-11-17 12:47 Sargun           I am ocnfused
2008-11-17 12:47 viaSanctus       didnt the guys from google buy a protocol from a student that made a voip protocol for fun ?
2008-11-17 12:47 viaSanctus       Sebboh, but slow voip networks
2008-11-17 12:48 diegoviola       Sebboh: recommend me some fast awesome line then

2008-11-17 12:48 diegoviola       pls
2008-11-17 12:48 Sebboh           Sargun, I have ipv6 connectivity though a VPN that leads to the other side of town.
2008-11-17 12:48 Sebboh           But I didn't know that until very recently.
2008-11-17 12:48 Sargun           HAhaha
2008-11-17 12:49 Sargun           That's one thing I love about v6
2008-11-17 12:49 Sebboh           viaSanctus: kindly explain to me what the heck the difference is between a "voip network" and the Internet?
2008-11-17 12:49 diegoviola       whats a fast line between US and UK
2008-11-17 12:49 diegoviola       for voip
2008-11-17 12:50 Sebboh           sargun what's weird is that .. The ISP on the other end of town.. is the same ISP I use here..  ... I'm going to go unplug my router and plug my cable modem directly into the linux computer and see if I can get a ipv6 IP via dhcp.. =P
2008-11-17 12:50 Sargun           IPv6 doesn't do dhcp
2008-11-17 12:50 Sargun           it uses autconfigure
2008-11-17 12:51 Sebboh           That's like saying "what's a fast road for oranges".  ..Nobody cares what you're going to ship, just take the highway.
2008-11-17 12:51 diegoviola       well, whats a good line
2008-11-17 12:52 diegoviola       between US-UK
2008-11-17 12:52 Sebboh           Sargun, when you say autoconfigure, you don't mean .. like, the way windows "auto configures" a DHCP interface when no DHCP response is received.. do you? =P
2008-11-17 12:56 Sebboh           diegoviola: I was unable to locate that information with a few google searches.  I recommend purchasing a line that is just fast in general, and then testing it to your UK office or whatever.  Or if you just call some big ISP and explain the situation I'm sure they'd be happy to give you a sales spiel.

2008-11-17 15:44 Sebboh           So I'm using openVPN..  I run the server, and I am the client.  And my tap0 on a client has been assigned a global ipv6 address.  *it works*..  But I have *no idea* who is providing me this service.  I'm really confused.  Help?
2008-11-17 15:45 Sebboh           Here's a more specific question: how can I monitor the process that happens when an ipv6 address is assigned or autoconfigured or whatever?  If I watch that process, I can tell where the IP is coming from, right?

2008-11-17 21:39 Randy            "oh, it's what you do to me... times square don't shine as bright as you.."
2008-11-17 21:39 Randy            etc.
2008-11-17 21:39 Randy            no, they focus on being beautiful and the beta males go up to them and praise them.
2008-11-17 21:39 Randy            importantly and for one, i am thinking that i should embrace materialism like pretty women do.
2008-11-17 21:40 Randy            i should be spending more on myself.
2008-11-17 21:40 Randy            what do you think of that?
2008-11-17 21:40 Randy            does that make sense?

2008-11-17 21:41 Randy            i'm looking to be to women as women are to average men.
2008-11-17 21:41 Randy            i want to be "hot" and i want the women to praise me.
2008-11-17 21:43 Randy            women seem to be naturally alpha.
2008-11-17 21:43 Randy            i admire them like that.
2008-11-17 21:44 Randy            there are guys all over youtube jerking their penises to anything "feminine."
2008-11-17 21:45 Randy            somehow "femininity" has come to being associated with the "alpha" the average men fall to their knees and worship.
2008-11-17 21:46 Randy            women have it so much easier than average beta male men. i just want to be the male version of that.

2008-11-17 22:08 Randy            it's usually her vanity and her materialism.

2008-11-18 12:53 votz             I have a Linksys BEFW1154 wireless router that I'm putting through some heavy use. By that I mean it's downloading anywhere from 400 to 1000 kb/s all the time. I recently hooked up another machine to the router and it's performance is pretty bad, with huge ping spikes ( 20ms to 120ms ) to different servers. I'm almost sure it's not my connection, but the router. What could be going wrong?

2008-11-18 12:56 Ac-town          are there any difference in the two computers hardware or anything to do with the connection to the router?
2008-11-18 12:58 votz             Ac-town: ya the computers themselves are different hardware. There's a group of 4 machines on a hub that are all connected to one router LAN port, and I just added another machine to another one of the router's LAN ports
2008-11-18 12:59 votz             I'm thinking I might be maxing out some router resource which would cause an increase in ping and spikes ( cpu, memory, something )
2008-11-18 12:59 votz             It is a rather old router
2008-11-18 13:00 votz             But I don't have another router on hand to swap out and try, so I'm here trying to see if anybody else knows other tests I can do to figure out what the problem is
2008-11-18 13:01 Ac-town          I dont know of any tests off hand
2008-11-18 13:01 Ac-town          have you tried to remove the hub and plug as much as you can into the router directly?
2008-11-18 13:02 Ac-town          and see if that fixes anything?
2008-11-18 13:02 votz             Ac-town: not enough ports unfortunately
2008-11-18 13:02 votz             It's only a 5 port router
2008-11-18 13:02 votz             *4 port
2008-11-18 13:02 Ac-town          well, this would be to test to see if it could be the hub
2008-11-18 13:03 votz             The machine that's having the performance issues isn't on the hub
2008-11-18 13:03 votz             It's on the router that the hub is connected to
2008-11-18 13:03 votz             If that makes sense
2008-11-18 13:03 Ac-town          ok
2008-11-18 13:03 Ac-town          have you tryed it on the hub and moved another machine directly to the router?
2008-11-18 13:03 votz             The only reason I just realized the performance issues is because I joined a counter strike deathmatch game :)
2008-11-18 13:03 Ac-town          lol
2008-11-18 13:03 Ac-town          its is deathmatch
2008-11-18 13:03 votz             And watched with net_graph my ping be twice as high
2008-11-18 13:03 votz             and then it spiked all around
2008-11-18 13:03 Ac-town          and 120ms ping is not too bad in cs
2008-11-18 13:04 votz             The machines downloading aren't having any problems
2008-11-18 13:04 votz             But I don't care if stuff spikes there, they just have to download their files
2008-11-18 13:04 Ac-town          well were are they download from?
2008-11-18 13:04 Ac-town          and where is the cs server?
2008-11-18 13:04 votz             All over, theyre spiders
2008-11-18 13:04 votz             cs server is in NYC, I usually ping 12-18 there
2008-11-18 13:05 votz             Maybe it's their end or the network, I dont know, but  I didn't see anybody else spiking
2008-11-18 13:05 Ac-town          it could be
2008-11-18 13:05 votz             ill go do some more testing
2008-11-18 13:05 Ac-town          try one on the hub and one on the router to the same game
2008-11-18 13:05 Ac-town          it could be a bad net card, bad port on the router
2008-11-18 13:05 votz             Hmm
2008-11-18 13:06 Ac-town          or a faulty cable, but that very rare
2008-11-18 13:06 Ac-town          i have only seen one busted net cable lol
2008-11-18 13:06 votz             How much traffic can I router handle before performance starts to get jumpy like that?
2008-11-18 13:06 votz             Or usually are routers so powerful that never really happens
2008-11-18 13:06 Ac-town          well, what is your isp?

2008-11-18 13:06 Ac-town          ah
2008-11-18 13:06 samix            /join 
2008-11-18 13:07 Ac-town          yeah, they might be throttling you
2008-11-18 13:07 Ac-town          unless they dont have any rules in place about excess network usage
2008-11-18 13:07 votz             I thought of that as well. I'ma try unplugging from the router directly to somewhere else and try again
2008-11-18 13:07 Ac-town          cause 400-1000kbps all the time is alot
2008-11-18 13:07 votz             Ya, it adds up ;)
2008-11-18 13:08 Ac-town          lol yeah
2008-11-18 13:08 votz             I'm testing my ping to different servers now
2008-11-18 13:08 votz             off of the router
2008-11-18 13:08 Ac-town          at the adverage of 600kbps in a day, its 6 gigs
2008-11-18 13:08 votz             Is that a general rule of thumb?
2008-11-18 13:08 votz             /action does the math
2008-11-18 13:09 Ac-town          i rounded
2008-11-18 13:09 votz             Ya
2008-11-18 13:09 votz             ~5.1gb
2008-11-18 13:09 votz             But close for that rule of thumb
2008-11-18 13:09 Ac-town          	
2008-11-18 13:09 Ac-town          (600 kbps) * 1 day = 6.17980957 gigabytes
2008-11-18 13:10 votz             Ya something is definitely going on
2008-11-18 13:10 votz             Two different servers my latency is spiking
2008-11-18 13:10 votz             30ms to 120ms
2008-11-18 13:10 votz             usually from 40-70ms
2008-11-18 13:10 Ac-town          stop the downloads?
2008-11-18 13:10 votz             then every once in a while it will jump to 120ms for a bit
2008-11-18 13:10 votz             Ac-town: ya doing that now and trying again
2008-11-18 13:10 Ac-town          ok
2008-11-18 13:11 Ac-town          whats the server? i'd join lol
2008-11-18 13:11 votz             You US-east?
2008-11-18 13:11 Ac-town          na, but im bored and im slacking on homework
2008-11-18 13:12 Ac-town          so might as well play some cs
2008-11-18 13:12 votz             Stopping the downloads fixes it
2008-11-18 13:12 votz             Ping drops back down to what it normally is
2008-11-18 13:13 Ac-town          so you could find a balance to where the downloads can run at and still play cs
2008-11-18 13:13 Ac-town          or just stop the downloads while you play
2008-11-18 13:13 votz             Latter isn't really an option
2008-11-18 13:13 votz             They're spiders that need to crawl
2008-11-18 13:13 votz             Also it's not really cs that I care about
2008-11-18 13:14 votz             That's just how I noticed it
2008-11-18 13:14 Ac-town          ah
2008-11-18 13:14 votz             The performance issues I mean
2008-11-18 13:14 Ac-town          yeah
2008-11-18 13:14 votz             I noticed my websites loading much more slowly, too
2008-11-18 13:14 votz             but didn't really put two and two together
2008-11-18 13:14 votz             Until I booted up cs for the first time in ages
2008-11-18 13:14 votz             And saw that happening
2008-11-18 13:15 Ac-town          what kind of spiders are you running?
2008-11-18 13:16 votz             Web crawlers
2008-11-18 13:16 votz             http
2008-11-18 13:16 Ac-town          ah, good times
2008-11-18 13:17 votz             Ac-town: are you us-east?
2008-11-18 13:17 Ac-town          na, im on the west

2008-11-18 13:37 votz             Ac-town: thanks for your help, I think I'ma try a different router
2008-11-18 13:37 votz             Ac-town: just can't do that now, but I'll try that later I mean
2008-11-18 13:38 votz             Ac-town: have you ever experienced, or heard of, a router causing spikes like this because it can't support such throughput?
2008-11-18 13:38 votz             I find this doubtful considering it is a 10/100 router, meaning it should be fully capable of speeds well above 600kb/s without causing spikes
2008-11-18 13:38 DaSkreech        Can I flash a router without an IP address?
2008-11-18 13:38 votz             There is no very little upload going on, mostly download
2008-11-18 13:39 votz             DaSkreech: without an IP? what do you mean? Turn it on, plug in a laptop, and go to the router's IP and update the firmware ( flash it )
2008-11-18 13:39 votz             that what you mean?
2008-11-18 13:39 DaSkreech        I don't know the router's IP
2008-11-18 13:39 DaSkreech        DHCP is off on it
2008-11-18 13:39 votz             DaSkreech: what brand is your router? All router manufacturer's give their routers default IP's
2008-11-18 13:39 DaSkreech        WRT54g
2008-11-18 13:40 votz             DaSkreech: DHCP is only for the clients, not the router
2008-11-18 13:40 votz             DaSkreech: What brand is that? Not the model number, but the brand
2008-11-18 13:40 DaSkreech        Yes but I need to be on the same network
2008-11-18 13:40 DaSkreech        Linksys
2008-11-18 13:40 votz             DaSkreech: default linksys router ip is 192.168.1.1
2008-11-18 13:40 votz             Plug in a machine into the router, open your browser, and go to 192.168.1.1
2008-11-18 13:40 votz             should prompt you for the router username and password
2008-11-18 13:41 DaSkreech        hmm
2008-11-18 13:41 DaSkreech        ok
2008-11-18 13:41 votz             make sure you have the flash image on the machine before you hook it up to the router
2008-11-18 13:41 votz             unless that router has internet
2008-11-18 13:41 votz             ( where you'd just download the image )
2008-11-18 13:41 DaSkreech        I wouldn't know I can't get on the router
2008-11-18 13:41 votz             lol
2008-11-18 13:41 votz             Are you upgrading the firmware?
2008-11-18 13:41 DaSkreech        It doesn't have DHCP turned on so I have to guess what network it's on
2008-11-18 13:42 DaSkreech        No I just want to get to the configuration page somehow
2008-11-18 13:42 votz             DaSkreech: that's not exactly what DHCP does
2008-11-18 13:42 DaSkreech        Oh?
2008-11-18 13:42 votz             DaSkreech: ya, plug a machine into the router
2008-11-18 13:42 votz             DaSkreech: then on that machine, open a browser and go to 192.168.1.1
2008-11-18 13:42 DaSkreech        Right and then set my IP on the machine
2008-11-18 13:42 DaSkreech        my ip is 0.0.0.0
2008-11-18 13:42 votz             DaSkreech: then login, probably with default username and password
2008-11-18 13:42 DaSkreech        ok
2008-11-18 13:42 DaSkreech        brb
2008-11-18 13:43 votz             You should not need to have dhcp enabled to talk to the router
2008-11-18 13:43 votz             and if that's the case, then set your ip statically in windows to something
2008-11-18 13:43 votz             or linux
2008-11-18 13:43 votz             192.168.1.100 or w/e
2008-11-18 13:44 votz             I'll be back later, hopefully if you need further help someone else in here will be able to help you
2008-11-18 13:45 Ac-town          votz, yeah, i dont see your router being the issue in this case, but it dosent hurt to try
2008-11-18 13:45 votz             Ac-town: what else do you think it would be?
2008-11-18 13:46 DaSkreech        Nope
2008-11-18 13:46 DaSkreech        Not seeing anything
2008-11-18 13:46 Ac-town          throttling would be my best guess from the information gathered
2008-11-18 13:46 DaSkreech        Wait I know!
2008-11-18 13:47 votz             Ac-town: hmm. that would cause spikes you think?
2008-11-18 13:47 Ac-town          yeah
2008-11-18 13:47 votz             Ac-town: so that would be network routers out of my control somehow adjusting my connection on the fly, hence causing latencies increase and spikes?
2008-11-18 13:47 Ac-town          yeah
2008-11-18 13:47 votz             Ya, alright
2008-11-18 13:47 votz             I'll make some calls
2008-11-18 13:48 Ac-town          cause its shared internet
2008-11-18 13:48 votz             Ac-town: thanks my friend :) Maybe I'll see you in strike one day :D
2008-11-18 13:48 Ac-town          lol maybe
2008-11-18 13:48 DaSkreech        bah
2008-11-18 13:49 DaSkreech        I'm thinking this thing is dead
2008-11-18 13:49 Ac-town          DaSkreech, linux or windows?
2008-11-18 13:49 DaSkreech        Linux
2008-11-18 13:49 Ac-town          whats your local ip?
2008-11-18 13:51 DaSkreech        When connected to the Internet modem 192.168.9.2
2008-11-18 13:51 DaSkreech        When connected to the wireless router 0.0.0.0
2008-11-18 13:53 Ac-town          download whatever you need to flash
2008-11-18 13:53 DaSkreech        right
2008-11-18 13:53 DaSkreech        then?
2008-11-18 13:53 Ac-town          connect the modem into the router's uplink, your computer into the router's port, then flash it
2008-11-18 13:53 DaSkreech        How ?
2008-11-18 13:53 Ac-town          well i assume the modem is going directly to your computer?
2008-11-18 13:54 DaSkreech        I just tried that and I see a 192.168.9.7 Ip address
2008-11-18 13:54 DaSkreech        When I try to connect to that I get nothing
2008-11-18 13:54 DaSkreech        yes
2008-11-18 13:54 Ac-town          so list me the name's of the ports and plugins in the back of the router
2008-11-18 13:54 DaSkreech        uplink and 4 ports
2008-11-18 13:54 Ac-town          ok
2008-11-18 13:55 DaSkreech        I connected uplink to the Modem and then I connected to the Modem as well
2008-11-18 13:55 DaSkreech        Got the list of computers connected and saw two
2008-11-18 13:55 Ac-town          modem->uplink, one of the 4 ports->your computer
2008-11-18 13:55 DaSkreech        ok
2008-11-18 13:55 Ac-town          connect into the router
2008-11-18 13:55 DaSkreech        Ac-town: I don't know what IP address the router has
2008-11-18 13:56 Ac-town          we will find out once you do what i said above :)
2008-11-18 13:56 DaSkreech        ok

2008-11-18 14:00 Ac-town          so find the ip the wireless router is giving you

2008-11-18 14:01 Ac-town          restart the router?
2008-11-18 14:01 DaSkreech        did
2008-11-18 14:01 DaSkreech        Held down reset for 30 seconds as well
2008-11-18 14:01 Ac-town          hm

2008-11-18 14:04 cyberjames       Hi! I am using vmware and Im planning to have this kind of setup. Host (192.168.1.2), Guest-a (192.168.1.3), Guest-b (192.168.2.1). Is it possible that the Guest-b will be able to reach those network at 192.168.1.0/24? How do I do that? by adding route?
2008-11-18 14:05 DaSkreech        requests forever
2008-11-18 14:05 Ac-town          yeah, hmm
2008-11-18 14:05 Ac-town          the router might be foobar
2008-11-18 14:06 DaSkreech        I was told that it was working
2008-11-18 14:06 Ac-town          you could try another of one of the 4 ports on the router
2008-11-18 14:06 Ac-town          to rule out the possibly of that port being bad

2008-11-18 14:34 mynameisdeleted  what are the recommended router specs to fully be able to manage traffic on 20mbps bi-directional and 50mbps bi
2008-11-18 14:34 mynameisdeleted  if the lan is natted with a few ports forwarded
2008-11-18 14:34 mynameisdeleted  and its over pppoe
2008-11-18 14:34 mynameisdeleted  is 100mbps with vlan to seperate internal and external interfaces bad?
2008-11-18 14:35 mynameisdeleted  should the pppoe and lan be on seperate 100mbps connections
2008-11-18 14:35 mynameisdeleted  is a 2.0 GHZ P4 from 2001 still faster than most new hardware routers?
2008-11-18 14:36 mynameisdeleted  I cant run gigabit ethernet simultaneously with the graphics card because it reservs too much pci bandwidth
2008-11-18 14:37 mynameisdeleted  I have a mac mini I could make also function as a router which has built-in gigabit ethernet
2008-11-18 14:37 mynameisdeleted  and keeps running 24/7
2008-11-18 14:38 mynameisdeleted  it has an agp slot which basically cant run any graphics card newer than  a 5900
2008-11-18 14:40 mynameisdeleted  does anyone know a consumer grade router that will route 50mbps bi-directional with 100 simultaneous streams without lagging?
2008-11-18 14:40 mynameisdeleted  and supports gigabit ethernet and 802.11n

2008-11-18 14:56 TreeStump        all works fine
2008-11-18 14:56 Ac-town          not really, but go ahead lol
2008-11-18 14:56 TreeStump        but the ip's behine eth1 can talk to eth1:1
2008-11-18 14:56 TreeStump        because i havent enabled in iptables to accept packets from eth1 to eth1:1
2008-11-18 14:56 TreeStump        and in reverse
2008-11-18 14:57 Ac-town          ok
2008-11-18 14:57 MasterOfDisaster /join 
2008-11-18 14:59 TreeStump        just doing some googling would it be 'iptables -t filter -A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth1:1 -j ACCEPT'
2008-11-18 14:59 Ac-town          ok, hold on
2008-11-18 15:01 TreeStump        sorry i thought i would be coming on here asking some question as to why the router wouldnt route but figured out it was a iptables thing halfway through typing it lol

2008-11-21 18:09 Qjimbo           Hi, I'm trying to find if there is a way to run a DNS server that redirects the user to a webpage no matter what they type in, unless they are from a peticular IP, in which case it forwards the DNS request to the proper DNS server
2008-11-21 18:10 Qjimbo           sort of like a dummy dns server
2008-11-21 18:10 Qjimbo           just so I can convince my flatmates to pay their share of the internet bill by blocking their access
2008-11-21 18:10 Qjimbo           =P
2008-11-21 18:11 shankara         sounds like the 'captive portal' mechanism used in wifi hotspots ...
2008-11-21 18:11 Qjimbo           yes, exactly that

2008-11-21 18:14 shankara         or else you'd have to set up chillispot/monowall or one of the dedicated hotpot type applications, whcih you may not  strictly want.

2008-11-21 21:59 xand             you can use cat5 for phones
2008-11-21 22:04 zchaos           i know that
2008-11-21 22:04 zchaos           but the question is this
2008-11-21 22:04 zchaos           if the cable i punched down for networking can you sitll use it for telephone?
2008-11-21 22:04 zchaos           this rogers techininian is saying
2008-11-21 22:05 zchaos           to use it as networking you have to punch down 4 pairs
2008-11-21 22:05 zchaos           to use it as phone you only punch down 1 pair
2008-11-21 22:05 zchaos           can't use it as both for the sametime
2008-11-21 22:08 xand             I don't know about american wiring
2008-11-21 22:08 xand             (phone)
2008-11-21 22:08 xand             here people use rj45<->phone adaptors each end
2008-11-21 22:09 Vadtec           zchaos: i just wired my home using CAT5 for phone and internet
2008-11-21 22:09 Vadtec           i just split it up as I needed

2008-11-21 22:24 xchaos           well right now i'm only connected on 3 pair
2008-11-21 22:24 xchaos           and have internet access
2008-11-21 22:24 xchaos           how the hell is that happening
2008-11-21 22:24 xand             because, unless you use gigabit, you only use 2 pair
2008-11-21 22:25 Vadtec           what xand said
2008-11-21 22:25 xchaos           so i dont need to connect the 4th pair and there wont be any repercussions then?
2008-11-21 22:26 xand             it's best practice to connect it, and if you want to use gigabit you'll need it
2008-11-21 22:26 xchaos           sorry... but what do you mean gigabit
2008-11-21 22:26 xchaos           gigabit connection?
2008-11-21 22:26 Vadtec           1000mbit ethernet
2008-11-21 22:27 xchaos           oh
2008-11-21 22:27 xchaos           one more question
2008-11-21 22:27 xchaos           because we only punched down 3 pairs
2008-11-21 22:27 xchaos           the rogers tech has 1 pair left over
2008-11-21 22:27 xchaos           so he was going to install a little telephoen jack next tot he rj45 jack
2008-11-21 22:27 xchaos           so i can use the same cable for both networking and telephone
2008-11-21 22:27 xchaos           because 1 pair is still free
2008-11-21 22:27 xchaos           what do you think?
2008-11-21 22:28 Vadtec           i think thats part of what twisted pair wiring is all about
2008-11-21 22:28 xchaos           so its a good idea?
2008-11-21 22:28 Vadtec           well im doing it right now...
2008-11-21 22:28 Vadtec           the phone next to my PC is wired through the same line as its internet
2008-11-21 22:29 xchaos           ahhhh
2008-11-21 22:29 Vadtec           so yeah

2008-11-22 21:12 chalco           it looks like the only route you don't have directly connected is .3.x
2008-11-22 21:14 chalco           where is that subnet in relation to your router?
2008-11-22 21:14 chalco           also, where is your internet connection in relation to your router?
2008-11-22 21:15 srinivasa        chalco, The internet is connected to a cisco router which 172.16.0.1
2008-11-22 21:17 srinivasa        chalco, eth0 on the linux router can route the internet requests to 172.16.0.1 as it is defined as gateway
2008-11-22 21:17 chalco           yes
2008-11-22 21:17 chalco           however, the cisco router will need to have routes to 1.x, 2.x and 3.x via 0.11

2008-11-22 21:18 srinivasa        chalco, My doubt is - can all these network be in same subnet? say 255.255.255.0?
2008-11-22 21:19 chalco           no, they cannot. you may need to do some more reading on subnets
2008-11-22 21:20 srinivasa        chalco, Any reference?
2008-11-22 21:20 chalco           wikipedia is a good place to start

2008-11-22 22:05 chalco           srinivasa, yes, that will work, depending on what you are trying to do. those subnets are a little smal
2008-11-22 22:05 chalco           *small
2008-11-22 22:06 srinivasa        chalco, I understand the limitations :) Wiki was a good reading - thanks for a good starting point
2008-11-22 22:06 chalco           np
2008-11-22 22:06 srinivasa        Is there anyotherway than what I am talking
2008-11-22 22:07 chalco           there are many different ways, all depending on what you are trying to do. what are you trying to do?
2008-11-22 22:08 srinivasa        chalco, I work in a device lab - I am trying to isolate resources. General desktops users into one network, devices into a seperate network, shared resources into another
2008-11-22 22:08 srinivasa        chalco, Also I am breaking my device network into two parts
2008-11-22 22:09 chalco           the individual subnet arrangement isn't too critical
2008-11-22 22:10 chalco           the biggest thing will be for the cisco to have routes to those subnets
2008-11-22 22:10 chalco           presumably the cisco is performing NAT?
2008-11-22 22:10 srinivasa        chalco, Yes
2008-11-22 22:10 srinivasa        My cisco router pushes all to the linux router if it is local
2008-11-22 22:11 chalco           yes, but when you add routes, the cisco will need to know about them
2008-11-22 22:11 chalco           either use static routes or use a routing protocol like RIP
2008-11-22 22:13 srinivasa        I do not have access to the Cisco router - So I am thinking of managing it with in the linux router!
2008-11-22 22:13 chalco           then you will need to perform NAT on the linux router
2008-11-22 22:15 srinivasa        oh! I will try to understand that!

2008-11-23 22:11 pleed            Hi. I ve got a root server running xen with several pv/hvm domUs.  dom0 has got an ipv6 tunnel to sixxs.net , however i ve got around 4 % packet loss when doing "ping6 -c 100 sixxs.net" . ipv4 pings havent got packet loss.  When i tcpdumped that, i saw every packet going out but some were unanswered. icmp/icmpv6 is completely allowed at the moment.  On my domUs it s even worse because in addition a lot of packets are not corretly routed
2008-11-23 22:22 pleed            Okay i built an ip6 in ip4 tunnel to my home router which pinged6 without packetloss, sixxs seems to be the problem

2008-11-27 09:36 riyonuk          AirPort is connected to WLAN_AP and has the IP address 192.168.0.146
2008-11-27 09:36 Kevin`           and you want to connect from "laptop" to "windows box"?
2008-11-27 09:37 Kevin`           interesting that those are all WAN ips, kinda neat, but not very safe from security perspective
2008-11-27 09:38 riyonuk          Yup, want to see my windows box, from my macbook, using vnc or whatever I can
2008-11-27 09:38 riyonuk          How is that neat? Tis annoying :P
2008-11-27 09:38 Kevin`           forward the vnc port to it from the ics box's firewall configuration

2008-11-27 09:39 Kevin`           spree: some point upstream? are you on cable?
2008-11-27 09:39 riyonuk          I don't have a router, was considering buying one at Wal-Mart, but it's friggen $70 :P
2008-11-27 09:39 spree            it's some cisco that i dont manage
2008-11-27 09:39 spree            yes im on cable
2008-11-27 09:40 Kevin`           how much is a "flood"?, you will see a LOT of arp requests in normal operation if you are connected directly to cable
2008-11-27 09:40 spree            i found this out through wireshark. im getting like 800 arp requests a minute from this thing
2008-11-27 09:40 Kevin`           ignore.
2008-11-27 09:40 Kevin`           and blocking that device would be.. unwise :)
2008-11-27 09:40 spree            why is it doing that
2008-11-27 09:40 Kevin`           since it's probably your next-hop router
2008-11-27 09:40 Kevin`           it's doing arp. for stations connected to cable.

2008-11-27 13:10 twocats1fish     Sounds very unlikely.
2008-11-27 13:10 twocats1fish     Same public one, that is, naturally.

2008-11-27 13:43 twocats1fish     They charge extra. And then you only get ONE anyway.

2008-11-27 13:44 Kevin`           because I use it here?
2008-11-27 13:44 twocats1fish     ?

2008-11-27 13:45 Kevin`           a range of ips
2008-11-27 13:45 twocats1fish     I don't doubt that it exists as a concept, of course.
2008-11-27 13:45 twocats1fish     Just that my ISP... nevermind.
2008-11-27 13:45 Kevin`           you called their 'business' half?
2008-11-27 13:46 twocats1fish     Huh?
2008-11-27 13:47 Kevin`           my experience is you usually talk to different people for that kind of service

2008-11-27 14:13 twocats1fish     It doesn't use PPPoA atall.
2008-11-27 14:13 twocats1fish     at all
2008-11-27 14:13 twocats1fish     Or PPPoE.
2008-11-27 14:13 twocats1fish     It uses that third option.
2008-11-27 14:13 twocats1fish     No login crap.
2008-11-27 14:13 Kevin`           which is?

2008-11-27 20:39 saftsack         hi, my cable ethernet stops working after some gbytes sending (ubuntu 8.10 server, linux 2.6.27-7, via_rhine, hardware is ok)
2008-11-27 20:42 rvsjoen          what makes you suspect the cable ?
2008-11-27 20:44 saftsack         i said cable so that nobody thinks that this is a wireless card
2008-11-27 20:44 rvsjoen          ah
2008-11-27 20:45 saftsack         rvsjoen, after a ifconfig eth0 down and ifconfig eth0 ip up it works for a couple of mbytes
2008-11-27 20:45 saftsack         it seems that this is no driver bug
2008-11-27 20:45 rvsjoen          nothing in the logs ? dmesg ?
2008-11-27 20:45 saftsack         nothing :(
2008-11-27 20:45 rvsjoen          TX errors in ifconfig ?

2008-11-27 20:47 rvsjoen          with end nodes running with the same speed ? auto-negotiation ok ?
2008-11-27 20:47 saftsack         atm i have mii-tool watching the state
2008-11-27 20:47 rvsjoen          hm
2008-11-27 20:47 saftsack         the machine runs with suse linux before, more than a year without problems. just installed a new system (ubuntu 8.10 server)
2008-11-27 20:48 saftsack         first i thought the via_rhine driver is buggy, so i inserted a rt8169 based card. same error
2008-11-27 20:48 rvsjoen          anything else you can do that makes it start working again ? clear arp table, static arp entries, re-auto-negotiate etc etc
2008-11-27 20:49 saftsack         rvsjoen, i will test those things when the machine goes down the next time
2008-11-27 20:49 saftsack         the only 2 services over the net which are running are nfs-kernel-server and sshd
2008-11-27 20:49 saftsack         maybe does portmap some crap with the network settings
2008-11-27 20:50 rvsjoen          does the machine go completely offline or is it just nfs that stops working ?
2008-11-27 20:51 saftsack         completely offline. on a local terminal i can ping after a short time other hosts in the net with a ping of 4000ms
2008-11-27 20:51 saftsack         after an ifconfig down and up everything works fine for a short time
2008-11-27 20:52 saftsack         and some other important point. no interrupt sharing!
2008-11-27 20:52 rvsjoen          anything between the two hosts that can cause problems ?
2008-11-27 20:53 saftsack         no everything else here in the net works fine.
2008-11-27 20:53 saftsack         the host is directly plugged in an unmanaged switch and worked with this configuration for at least one year
2008-11-27 20:56 rvsjoen          does this also happen if you try to do other stuff than nfs ?
2008-11-27 20:56 saftsack         you mean: turn of nfs and portmap and then do e.g. scp and wait for the error?
2008-11-27 20:57 rvsjoen          for example, or leave nfs running and still use scp
2008-11-27 20:57 saftsack         this is on my plan too.
2008-11-27 20:57 saftsack         but i have to test this ...
2008-11-27 20:57 rvsjoen          ubuntu8.10 is the stable release ?
2008-11-27 20:57 saftsack         but this error is so strange
2008-11-27 20:59 saftsack         rvsjoen, yes
2008-11-27 20:59 saftsack         and after the first occur updated with the latest updates
2008-11-27 21:00 rvsjoen          sounds weird
2008-11-27 21:01 saftsack         one another strange thing: after disabling usb in the bios more time gones until the error occurs
2008-11-27 21:01 saftsack         maybe an error related to acpi or smp? because the old system hadnt smp support
2008-11-27 21:09 saftsack         Nov 27 11:52:11 l6 kernel: [   31.500037] eth0: no IPv6 routers present

2008-11-27 21:42 twocats1fish     I have ADSL Internet. My ISP gives me 5 dynamic but real (external) IP addresses. They don't change very often, and I basically have to switch MAC address or be disconnected for a long time for them to change. Now, I am trying to make my FreeBSD 7 server with ONE LAN port to use TWO different IP addresses instead of one. How can I do this?
2008-11-27 21:42 twocats1fish     The reason I wanna do this is because I need to host two SSL Web sites, and HTTPS dictates one IP address per site.
2008-11-27 21:46 SpComb           twocats1fish: dynamic as in DHCP?
2008-11-27 21:46 twocats1fish     Yes.
2008-11-27 21:46 SpComb           you'll need two MAC addresses for that box then, presumeably
2008-11-27 21:47 twocats1fish     Uhuh...
2008-11-27 21:47 twocats1fish     Is that possible?
2008-11-27 21:47 twocats1fish     Since it only has one "NIC"?
2008-11-27 21:47 SpComb           you could have two virtual interfaces with some semirandom MAC address
2008-11-27 21:47 twocats1fish     I really have zero idea how to actually do this.
2008-11-27 21:48 rvsjoen          you can add multiple ip addresses to the same interface
2008-11-27 21:49 twocats1fish     rvsjoen: Please enlighten me.
2008-11-27 21:49 SpComb           rvsjoen: that won't helpp him run multiple DHCP clients on one interface
2008-11-27 21:50 rvsjoen          true
2008-11-27 21:50 xand             whenever I've seen virtual interfaces on the same card they've always had the same MAC address
2008-11-27 21:50 xand             unless freebsd does something different a second NIC may be needed if you don't have static IPs
2008-11-27 21:50 twocats1fish     :(
2008-11-27 21:50 twocats1fish     That sucks.
2008-11-27 21:50 xand             but I don't know for sure.
2008-11-27 21:51 twocats1fish     Stupid HTTPS >:(
2008-11-27 21:51 xand             running servers on dynamic IP addresses is asking for trouble unfortunately
2008-11-27 21:54 twocats1fish     Um...
2008-11-27 21:54 twocats1fish     DNS was invented for a reason...
2008-11-27 21:55 twocats1fish     I have run my server on "dynamic" IP addresses for years.
2008-11-27 21:55 twocats1fish     Only every few months does it change if I take it offline.
2008-11-27 21:56 xand             DNS was not invented for dynamic addresses
2008-11-27 21:56 xand             it was designed so you don't have to type in ip addresses
2008-11-27 21:57 xand             type in/remember
2008-11-27 21:57 twocats1fish     Why are you arguing about unrelated, pointless stuff?
2008-11-27 21:57 xand             I was correcting you.
2008-11-27 21:57 twocats1fish     It was made to have a fixed, easy-to-remember address.
2008-11-27 21:57 xand             but my point stands... if you had static IPs then you wouldn't have a problem with two addresses on one NIC
2008-11-27 21:58 twocats1fish     Then I could put them in some sort of table?
2008-11-27 21:59 xand             don't know how you do it on freebsd; on linux you just use the ifconfig command (or your distro's network config file) to create a virtual interface with whatever IP address etc.
2008-11-27 22:01 twocats1fish     I just confirmed with my ISP: If I pay extra for their fixed IP address service, I only get ONE fixed IP address.
2008-11-27 22:01 twocats1fish     Worthless, in other words.

2008-11-28 22:07 paul68           well I have in my dhcp config the possible known hosts declared for example my laptop gets 192.168.3.40 so if i comment out these lines I should get a ip in the "range for unknown users"
2008-11-28 22:08 rvsjoen          ah, yes if you make the client renew the lease
2008-11-28 22:08 paul68           then I can check if I am able to do surf only the internet and nothing else right
2008-11-28 22:09 rvsjoen          yes
2008-11-28 22:09 rvsjoen          anyone on the  192.168.3.0/25 subnet should get full access
2008-11-28 22:11 paul68           did my homework and had a lot of help from you and others
2008-11-28 22:14 rvsjoen          what more could one ask :-)
2008-11-28 22:16 paul68           just started with linux 8 months ago and build a full server lamp dhcp dns samba ftp to name a view is samba impacted by the iptables ?
2008-11-28 22:17 rvsjoen          yes
2008-11-28 22:18 paul68           then we just need to add a rule to make this work then
2008-11-28 22:18 paul68           brb bathroom time :-)
2008-11-28 22:19 rvsjoen          samba uses a few different ports, http://troy.jdmz.net/samba/fw/ that looks like a nice guide
2008-11-28 22:19 rvsjoen          udp 137,138 and tcp 139,445

2008-12-03 09:18 robink           Inssomniak: Most routing stacks don't dictate that the remote gateway be in a netblock you already have a route for.
2008-12-03 09:19 Tramp            Inssomniak: yep, a private /30 to save IPs is a pretty normal setup.
2008-12-03 09:19 robink           Inssomniak: I could have a 3.4.5.6/24 netblock and have 1.2.3.4 as my nexthop for 0.0.0.0/0, and that would work, provided 1.2.3.4 was at the other end of the link, right?
2008-12-03 09:19 Inssomniak       true but that was the way the ISP did it, I didnt have much of a choice at the time
2008-12-03 09:19 robink           Inssomniak: With a /30 you still have to throw away two IPs.
2008-12-03 09:20 Inssomniak       robink, well the network and broadcast IPs are typically not useable on most routers
2008-12-03 09:20 robink           Inssomniak: Indeed.  I consider them reserved.
2008-12-03 09:26 Inssomniak       I run a WISP, I have a /29 subnet for some of my core routers, and my /24 is all divided up into each ip /32 and route over private ip space
