2008-11-11 09:28 geist            but i screwed around with that one quite a bit, figuring out the math
2008-11-11 09:31 Dr_Link          nn: What if I dev on Linux but game on Windows?
2008-11-11 09:32 Dr_Link          In all seriousness, I have an issue with kstrcmp()

2008-11-11 09:32 geist            uhhh
2008-11-11 09:32 geist            did you look at what the return codes to strcmp mean?

2008-11-11 09:34 Dr_Link          It's a strcmp clone,

2008-11-11 09:34 Dr_Link          I'M NOT USING THE STANDARD LIBRARY.
2008-11-11 09:34 nn               so why not read the man page and write it to behave as the libc version does?
2008-11-11 09:34 nn               or does that make too much sense?
2008-11-11 09:34 geist            yeah, if it's a strcmp clone, you'd actually return the same way strcmp works
2008-11-11 09:34 Dr_Link          It makes sense.
2008-11-11 09:34 geist            ie. 0 == the same
2008-11-11 09:34 Dr_Link          that's how it's returning, either 1 or 0.
2008-11-11 09:34 Dr_Link          1 if they match, 0 if they don't.
2008-11-11 09:35 geist            that aint how strcmp works

2008-11-11 09:37 geist            yeah, dig out a bsd licensed implementation and be done with it
2008-11-11 09:37 nn               see:  http://fxr.watson.org/fxr/source/libkern/strcmp.c
2008-11-11 09:37 geist            yeah, that seems pretty reasonable
2008-11-11 09:38 geist            oh my. finally looked at your code
2008-11-11 09:38 geist            it's incredibly broken
2008-11-11 09:39 Dr_Link          I think I realize that now...
2008-11-11 09:39 Dr_Link          I guess I'm just too used to PHP these days, haven't touched a kernel in a while.
2008-11-11 09:39 geist            it's a lot more complicated than it needs to be
2008-11-11 09:39 Dr_Link          Yeah, I just pasted that code sample that nn gave into my code for study...
2008-11-11 09:39 Dr_Link          /action renamed it to kstrcmp for compatibility.
2008-11-11 09:40 geist            so what is your fixation without using a standard library?
2008-11-11 09:40 geist            seems that you essentially are, you're just pulling in the pieces as you need it
2008-11-11 09:40 geist            seems like a perfectly legitimate way to go
2008-11-11 09:41 Dr_Link          well, when I was stating I didn't want to use the standard library
2008-11-11 09:41 Dr_Link          I was referring to the standard library included at compile time
2008-11-11 09:41 geist            there is no single 'standard library'
2008-11-11 09:41 geist            it's just an api, either there's some code that implements it or not
2008-11-11 09:42 geist            in this case, you may need to implement the pieces as you need it
2008-11-11 09:42 geist            but it's all the same thing
2008-11-11 09:43 Dr_Link          well, I had my terminology wrong?
2008-11-11 09:43 Dr_Link          hey, it's a learning experience.
2008-11-11 09:43 geist            well, that's fine, but you started getting pretty aggressive about it
2008-11-11 09:43 Dr_Link          at least I'm screwing up now and not when I actually have a job doing this kind of thing.
2008-11-11 09:43 geist            so i just wanted to get you to chill out a bit
2008-11-11 09:43 Dr_Link          geist: Yeah, just getting a bit frustrated since I've tried to build a successful kernel for 2 years and I've just acquired barely enough skill to do it recently, so I've been itching to get it right.
2008-11-11 09:43 Dr_Link          sorry if I came on too strong. :/
2008-11-11 09:45 geist            as far as strcmp returning < or > than, it's sort of unimportant what it actually means
2008-11-11 09:45 geist            except that it always compares the same way
2008-11-11 09:46 geist            so if you're searching a 'sorted' list or something, or building a btree, you can have it be meaningful
2008-11-11 09:49 Dr_Link          well, at least I understand the inner workings of it now.
2008-11-11 09:49 Dr_Link          and it seems a bit backwards to me personally to return true if they're different, but I guess you could argue that it's a one sided standpoint to say that.
2008-11-11 09:49 Dr_Link          oh well.
2008-11-11 09:49 Dr_Link          Command line time.
2008-11-11 09:50 geist            that's because strcmp isn't logically the same thing as strequal
2008-11-11 09:50 geist            strcmp is comparing two strings, which means there are 3 seperate outcomes
2008-11-11 09:51 geist            if there was a strequal, then it has a boolean result
2008-11-11 09:51 geist            and 0 and 1 would make sense there
2008-11-11 09:51 Dr_Link          I had it a bit backwards and sideways if that's the case!
2008-11-11 09:51 Dr_Link          I seriously need to lay off the PHP.
2008-11-11 09:51 nn               and upside down
2008-11-11 09:51 nn               yes php will rot your brain, like visual basic
2008-11-11 09:51 geist            a lot of libc is pretty stupid and badly designed, but in this case i have to side with it
2008-11-11 09:52 geist            and anyway, i'm a huge fan of >= 0 for success, < for error
2008-11-11 09:52 geist            so a lot of my apis at least return 0 on success
2008-11-11 09:52 nn               i tend to use EXIT_SUCCESS (which internally == 0)

It's a simple test, and I bet staying up past 1:00 AM didn't help either (since my coding is off today, obviously, and so is my attitude >.>)
2008-11-11 10:03 Dr_Link          Yes, a good portion of that is stolen from bkerndev, don't kill me.

2008-11-11 10:17 apples`          blech, looking at his code, i see why
2008-11-11 10:22 Dr_Link          .
2008-11-11 10:22 Dr_Link          I feel pretty discouraged right now, about ready to punch a hole through my monitor.
2008-11-11 10:24 Dr_Link          damn it, I hate being a programmer who *may* have a slight case of dyslexia.

2008-11-11 10:27 Dr_Link          They're acting like my code doesn't compile
2008-11-11 10:27 Dr_Link          while I've been getting compilations just right for the past ... say, 15 builds?
2008-11-11 10:27 Dr_Link          And this one asshole keeps calling me a liar.
2008-11-11 10:27 geist            guess going to ##c wasn't a good idea
2008-11-11 10:30 Dr_Link          I'm going to finish what I've started

2008-11-11 10:35 Dr_Link          apples`, I know C.
2008-11-11 10:35 Dr_Link          I have been staying away from it for far too long to be jumping back into kernel development so soon.
2008-11-11 10:36 apples`          not well enough, it seems -- comparing a character to a string is a quite obvious syntax error
2008-11-11 10:36 Dr_Link          I had about a year and a half or two years of it with prior experience in other languages behind that as well.
2008-11-11 10:36 apples`          anyways, i'm not trying to bash you
2008-11-11 10:36 Dr_Link          I understand that.
2008-11-11 10:37 Dr_Link          Again, I've hit PHP too hard--because I'm not thinking structured enough anymore.
2008-11-11 10:42 ccfreak2k        Hell, I intend to heckle geist over raytracers now.
2008-11-11 10:43 Dr_Link          yeah, well

2008-11-11 10:49 ccfreak2k        Especially Zhivago. He resorts to personal attacks. I'm not even sure why.
2008-11-11 10:50 Dr_Link          You saw that too?
2008-11-11 10:50 apples`          yeah, him and Dianora got into it earlier
2008-11-11 10:50 apples`          about the meaning of a phrase

2008-11-11 10:51 Dr_Link          /action is shot.
2008-11-11 10:51 ccfreak2k        Dr_Link, I didn't have to see. I went through that before.
2008-11-11 10:51 Dr_Link          Just kidding, you know.
2008-11-11 10:51 Dr_Link          meh, what happened with you?
2008-11-11 10:51 ccfreak2k        I forgot.
2008-11-11 10:51 apples`          i remember getting bashed when i said 'c' wasn't of type int
2008-11-11 10:52 ccfreak2k        Just watch, though. If he isn't speaking to a channel regular, he's throwing names at them.
2008-11-11 10:52 Dr_Link          /action idles in said channel.
2008-11-11 10:52 Samy             Dr_Link, people that matter will judge you by the quality of your work, end of the day.
2008-11-11 10:52 Dr_Link          Hey, at least their bashing got me to realize my mistakes.
2008-11-11 10:52 Dr_Link          Still have one other bug, but I don't need to ask a question to fix this one.
2008-11-11 10:52 Samy             No, you need to learn C.
2008-11-11 10:52 Dr_Link          I know C.
2008-11-11 10:53 Dr_Link          Again, I haven't touched it nearly all year.
2008-11-11 10:53 Dr_Link          I think I last used it in January, to be honest.
2008-11-11 10:53 Dr_Link          And I've been using Java and PHP since then, not ever practicing C in between.
2008-11-11 10:53 Dr_Link          I'm a bad coder!
2008-11-11 10:54 jaacoppi         so, learn, just like everyone else
2008-11-11 10:54 Dr_Link          I think I learned a good amount in the last hour. heheheh...
2008-11-11 10:54 Dr_Link          but it's apparent
2008-11-11 10:54 Dr_Link          there's still much to be learned.
2008-11-11 10:55 Dr_Link          So I'm going to keep going with this (and not be a dumbass about it)
2008-11-11 10:55 Dr_Link          and actually give trial and error a chance.
2008-11-11 10:56 jaacoppi         that's my method as well

2008-11-11 11:01 jaacoppi         Personally, I know I don't know, but I don't take stress about it since I'm still learning and not getting paid to do it
2008-11-11 11:02 Dr_Link          yeah, this is all for hobby stuff.  I mean, to be honest with you, there probably is some concept or amount of concepts I don't even know in C yet.
2008-11-11 11:02 Dr_Link          But if I can follow a tutorial and understand it in order to make a now working kernel with a functional command line, yes, I think I'm on a roll here.

2008-11-11 17:17 pcmattman        you'll still need some form of shell though
2008-11-11 17:17 Mathis           well, not a command line
2008-11-11 17:17 nn               I fucking hate you, moused.
2008-11-11 17:17 pcmattman        what's wrong with a command line
2008-11-11 17:17 Mathis           normal users dont like typing on the keyboard anymore
2008-11-11 17:18 jaacoppi         ratpoison cures rodent problems
2008-11-11 17:18 jaacoppi         your OS will probably never be used by "normal" users
2008-11-11 17:18 Mathis           thats not the point
2008-11-11 17:18 pcmattman        i'm pretty sure you have a command line as a function for power users
2008-11-11 17:18 pcmattman        otherwise you'll be way too restricted by the gui
2008-11-11 17:18 pcmattman        unless it's highly unrestrictive, which means it'll be too complex
2008-11-11 17:18 nn               GUIs are pretty faggot
2008-11-11 17:19 Mathis           sure, but that wont be one of the first parts being developed
2008-11-11 17:19 pcmattman        ok
2008-11-11 17:19 pcmattman        i still think not having a command line of any sort in an OS is like going backwards
2008-11-11 17:19 Mathis           there were not many OSes having no prompt
2008-11-11 17:20 Mathis           I only remember one: Atari TOS
2008-11-11 17:21 jaacoppi         it's an interesting concept anyway
2008-11-11 17:22 pcmattman        you might be able to get by without it in a non-debug build
2008-11-11 17:22 jaacoppi         if you pull it off you'll have the possibility of creating something new
2008-11-11 17:22 pcmattman        but my shell for instance provides direct access to syscalls i provide that give me information like memory usage
2008-11-11 17:22 pcmattman        so i can debug things from the shell as they happen rather than post-mortem
2008-11-11 17:23 Mathis           my OS will be debugged from a COM port
2008-11-11 17:23 Mathis           using an IDE
2008-11-11 17:23 pcmattman        well, i have that as well, but only for output
2008-11-11 17:23 Mathis           it can be also used as input, for entering debug commands
2008-11-11 17:24 pcmattman        i chose not to allow that
2008-11-11 17:25 Mathis           you could see this as a commandline shell, but since it is for debugging only, it is not a shell
2008-11-11 17:27 pcmattman        so it can't do things like run programs and navigate filesystems?

2008-11-17 14:36 uncategorized    it this the right channel to ask basic questions about processors, memory etc?
2008-11-17 14:37 tantrika         sure
2008-11-17 14:38 uncategorized    mainly just a flurry of semi-related questions....
2008-11-17 14:38 uncategorized    i'm reading:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address
2008-11-17 14:38 geist            sure
2008-11-17 14:39 uncategorized    and saw word-addressable and byte-addressable....since each bye identifies an address....if something is word-addressable, does that mean it can access multiple address at once?
2008-11-17 14:39 geist            no, it just means a single address refers to a larger piece of memory
2008-11-17 14:39 uncategorized    then doesn't that just change what a byte is?
2008-11-17 14:40 uncategorized    ie:   address == byte
2008-11-17 14:40 tantrika         no, a byte is always 8 bits
2008-11-17 14:40 geist            kind of, but the physical memory bus and memory controller may still just split it up as a byte by the time it hits the cpu
2008-11-17 14:40 tantrika         address != byte
2008-11-17 14:40 geist            for example, most sdram is 32/64/128bit or more wide
2008-11-17 14:41 geist            so the memory controller may fetch on a larger boundary, but just return to the cpu the byte or whatnot it asked for
2008-11-17 14:41 tantrika         an address is just an address, the size of the memory at the address can be a byte or word or dword, etc
2008-11-17 14:41 uncategorized    i was just talking in c++ and some there were saying that a byte is not always 8 bits.  that is, a byte is just defined as the fundamental unit.
2008-11-17 14:41 geist            yes, i was going to mention that
2008-11-17 14:41 geist            it's just a defacto standard that a byte is 8 bits
2008-11-17 14:41 geist            but it wasn't always that way
2008-11-17 14:41 tantrika         eh, im guessing ur teacher said that?
2008-11-17 14:41 geist            and on some dsps and whatnot you'll still see funny sizes
2008-11-17 14:41 uncategorized    (in #c++)
2008-11-17 14:42 geist            technically speaking, C/C++ does not require that a char be 8 bits
2008-11-17 14:42 geist            or that an int is 32 or whatnot
2008-11-17 14:42 tantrika         ive never seen a dsp or other proc refer to a byte as anything other than 8 bits
2008-11-17 14:42 geist            i have
2008-11-17 14:42 uncategorized    so when word-addressable is used...do they mean byte as in 8 bits...or byte as in fundamental unit which could be more or less than 8 bits
2008-11-17 14:42 geist            some dsps have 26 bit words, etc
2008-11-17 14:42 geist            uncategorized: essentially the answer is 'all of the above'
2008-11-17 14:42 geist            it really depends on the design
2008-11-17 14:42 uncategorized    yuck
2008-11-17 14:42 uncategorized    ok
2008-11-17 14:43 uncategorized    i suppose so long as it is stated clearly, it is ok
2008-11-17 14:43 geist            but what mostly happens in general purpose cpus is the programmer sees 8/16/32/64 bit chunks, addresses are on 8 bit boundaries
2008-11-17 14:43 geist            and the implementation of how it is done in hardware can vary greatly
2008-11-17 14:43 geist            depends on how the memory controller, cache, bus, whatever works
2008-11-17 14:43 tantrika         many dsps work with variable sized bits, 12, 6, 24, etc, but they all say so
2008-11-17 14:44 tantrika         however, a BYTE is always 8 bits in my experience
2008-11-17 14:44 geist            sure, but it doesn't have to be
2008-11-17 14:44 uncategorized    ok...so now, when it is said that a CPU is 32-bit.....that means there are 32-bits for each memory address?
2008-11-17 14:45 geist            no, usually an address is in units of the smallest fetchable chunk
2008-11-17 14:45 geist            which on most 32bit general purpose cpus is 8 bits
2008-11-17 14:45 geist            you'll have to find a weird dsp or an old machine to find something else
2008-11-17 14:45 uncategorized    so how would you guys explain what the 32-bit means/refers to?
2008-11-17 14:46 geist            i thought i did a while ago
2008-11-17 14:46 geist            there's what you 'see' as a programmer and then there's what actually happens
2008-11-17 14:46 geist            what actually happens can be completely different between designs
2008-11-17 14:46 geist            what you 'see' is usually defined by the architecture
2008-11-17 14:46 geist            and most architectures define pretty much the same thing
2008-11-17 14:46 geist            address = 8 bits, etc
2008-11-17 14:46 tantrika         32-bit means several things depending on the context, in terms of memory address, 32 bits can be used to address memory 0xffffffffffffffff
2008-11-17 14:47 tantrika         means the cpu has 32 bits on the address bus
2008-11-17 14:47 geist            right
2008-11-17 14:47 geist            and the actual address 'bus' may be 28 bits, 16 bytes at a time, for example
2008-11-17 14:47 geist            but it doesn't matter, it effectively addresses 32 bits of bytes
2008-11-17 14:47 uncategorized    so it can store 2^32 different patterns
2008-11-17 14:48 tantrika         yes
2008-11-17 14:48 uncategorized    how should i interpret a pattern though....i know *what* it is...but how does the computer use that?
2008-11-17 14:48 geist            depeds on how it works
2008-11-17 14:48 uncategorized    is that the current memory?
2008-11-17 14:48 geist            the memory controller and cpus bus and all that works itself out
2008-11-17 14:49 geist            it's far more complicated than the idealized computer
2008-11-17 14:49 tantrika         the easiest way to think of it is 32 lines, a high line is 1 a low line is 0
2008-11-17 14:49 geist            right
2008-11-17 14:49 uncategorized    but what does it use it for?
2008-11-17 14:49 geist            so say you had a memory chip
2008-11-17 14:49 ArtVandalae      /join 
2008-11-17 14:49 tantrika         the address bus is used to address memory
2008-11-17 14:49 milyges          /join 
2008-11-17 14:49 geist            had 32 address lines, 32 data lines
2008-11-17 14:49 geist            er 8 data lines, actually
2008-11-17 14:49 geist            to keep it simple
2008-11-17 14:50 geist            so you put a pattern ont he 32 address lines, which you can interpret as an address from 0 - 0xffffffff
2008-11-17 14:50 geist            and the data at that address shows up on the data lines
2008-11-17 14:50 geist            make sense?
2008-11-17 14:50 uncategorized    the data is in the physical memory?
2008-11-17 14:51 geist            yes. this is an idealized memory chip i'm talking about
2008-11-17 14:51 geist            pretend it's a 4GB chip
2008-11-17 14:51 geist            make sense?
2008-11-17 14:51 uncategorized    so the 32 lines create 2^32 possible addresses....each address can access a different byte in the physical memory...and so that is how we get 4 GiB?
2008-11-17 14:52 geist            right
2008-11-17 14:52 uncategorized    aha..starting to understand this a bit more.
2008-11-17 14:53 geist            okay, so say you had two 2GB chips
2008-11-17 14:53 geist            each had 31 address lines and 8 data lines
2008-11-17 14:53 uncategorized    wait sorry, real quick
2008-11-17 14:53 uncategorized    the 8 data lines are?
2008-11-17 14:53 uncategorized    what are data lines?
2008-11-17 14:53 geist            they are physical pins on the chip
2008-11-17 14:53 geist            the data 'appears' on them by setting 0 or 1 based on the input address
2008-11-17 14:54 tantrika         address lines are used to read and write the data on the data lines
2008-11-17 14:54 geist            right, you then sample the data lines and you have the byte you had stored there
2008-11-17 14:54 uncategorized    ok...so it is the means by which you can pull/push to the main memory
2008-11-17 14:54 geist            right
2008-11-17 14:55 uncategorized    let me dig a bit more here
2008-11-17 14:55 uncategorized    so i put a particular patter on the 32 lines....
2008-11-17 14:55 geist            which ones? address lines?
2008-11-17 14:55 uncategorized    address
2008-11-17 14:55 uncategorized    sorry
2008-11-17 14:55 geist            okay
2008-11-17 14:55 uncategorized    are the data lines populated by the memory at that point
2008-11-17 14:55 geist            right
2008-11-17 14:55 uncategorized    or does the cpu have to ask it to tell you what is there?
2008-11-17 14:56 geist            well, yeah, but remember i'm giving a highly idealized version of memory
2008-11-17 14:56 geist            real memory chips work much differently
2008-11-17 14:56 tantrika         some memory chips are serial or I2C which is a bit different
2008-11-17 14:56 uncategorized    its ok...ths is all very new to me
2008-11-17 14:56 geist            this is a pretend memory chip where it's all simplified
2008-11-17 14:56 uncategorized    so non-idealized is def over my head
2008-11-17 14:56 geist            right, so pretend it's a very simple chip
2008-11-17 14:56 geist            simplest one is 32 address lines, 8 data lines, and 1 read/write line
2008-11-17 14:57 geist            0 on the rw line means the chip puts the data on the data lines for whatever is on the addres lines
2008-11-17 14:57 geist            1 on rw line means it samples what you put onto the data lines and stores it in it's memory
2008-11-17 14:57 uncategorized    so 1 is write?
2008-11-17 14:57 geist            correct
2008-11-17 14:57 uncategorized    from the chip perspective
2008-11-17 14:58 geist            correct
2008-11-17 14:58 uncategorized    and the CPU can write to each line (data or address) simultaneously?
2008-11-17 14:58 geist            this is more or less how a lot of ram worked say 20-25 years ago
2008-11-17 14:58 geist            stuff in your commodore 64
2008-11-17 14:58 geist            yeah
2008-11-17 14:58 uncategorized    wow...ok, all making much more sense
2008-11-17 14:58 uncategorized    ok
2008-11-17 14:58 geist            in electrical stuff it all happens simultaneously
2008-11-17 14:59 geist            so a lot of times memory busses are still refered to this way, as if it's a generalized abstraction of it
2008-11-17 14:59 eddyb            /join 
2008-11-17 14:59 geist            modern stuff is much more complicated, but it solves the same logical problem
2008-11-17 14:59 uncategorized    ok...now 8 data lines is because it is byte-addressable
2008-11-17 14:59 geist            right
2008-11-17 15:00 uncategorized    or can you have more data lines and still be byte-addressable
2008-11-17 15:00 geist            or less
2008-11-17 15:00 geist            say you did this
2008-11-17 15:00 geist            what if you had 2 4bit data chips
2008-11-17 15:00 geist            32 address / 4 data lines
2008-11-17 15:00 geist            and you wired them in parallel so that one of them stored the low part of each byte and one stored the high
2008-11-17 15:00 geist            the cpu sees the same thing
2008-11-17 15:01 geist            or you had 8 1 bit wide memory chips
2008-11-17 15:01 geist            32 address / 1 data line, 8 of them in parallel
2008-11-17 15:01 geist            it would work exactly the same way, and the cpu doesn't care where the bits are stored
2008-11-17 15:01 uncategorized    i see
2008-11-17 15:02 uncategorized    so the x-bit memory chips says that there will be x data lines
2008-11-17 15:02 geist            usually it's how 'wide' the chip is
2008-11-17 15:02 geist            how much it fetches in one access
2008-11-17 15:02 geist            the total bits it stores is width * number of addressable slots
2008-11-17 15:02 uncategorized    ok this is all making sense....arrange memory how ever you want....the CPU is dinstinct and doesn't really care
2008-11-17 15:03 geist            now, you can go the other way
2008-11-17 15:03 geist            say you had a 16 bit wide memory chip
2008-11-17 15:03 uncategorized    just that it has 8 incoming data lines and 32 address lines.
2008-11-17 15:03 uncategorized    ...ok and vice versa
2008-11-17 15:03 geist            but you still wanted to address in 8 bit boundaries
2008-11-17 15:03 geist            say you had a chip that had 31 address lines, 16 data lines
2008-11-17 15:03 geist            still 4GB, right?
2008-11-17 15:03 uncategorized    yup!
2008-11-17 15:04 uncategorized    but why 31 address lines....
2008-11-17 15:04 uncategorized    or was that arbitrary
2008-11-17 15:04 geist            because it's wider
2008-11-17 15:04 geist            16 bits wide
2008-11-17 15:04 geist            it's a 4GB chip, so since it returns more bits at a time it needs one less address
2008-11-17 15:05 geist            this is where we learn if you really picked up what we were talking about before...
2008-11-17 15:05 uncategorized    i think i just screwed up 
2008-11-17 15:05 geist            i think you did too
2008-11-17 15:05 uncategorized    let me restate how i intepret your situation
2008-11-17 15:05 uncategorized    memory has 16 data lines
2008-11-17 15:05 uncategorized    didn't specify how many address lines
2008-11-17 15:06 geist            i did. 31 address lines
2008-11-17 15:06 uncategorized    so we can have a CPU with 16 address lines
2008-11-17 15:06 uncategorized    oh
2008-11-17 15:06 uncategorized    i thought that second chip was the cpu
2008-11-17 15:06 geist            23:03 < geist> say you had a chip that had 31 address lines, 16 data lines
2008-11-17 15:06 geist            no, i'm moving to the other typw of memory layout
2008-11-17 15:06 uncategorized    ok. lets start again then.    your memory chip has 31 address lines and 16 data lines
2008-11-17 15:06 uncategorized    now what
2008-11-17 15:06 geist            right, so it returns 2 bytes at a time, right?
2008-11-17 15:07 uncategorized    yes
2008-11-17 15:07 uncategorized    16/2
2008-11-17 15:07 geist            you could say the chip is 16 bit word addressable
2008-11-17 15:07 uncategorized    16/8
2008-11-17 15:07 geist            but the cpu still wants to address 1 byte at a time
2008-11-17 15:07 geist            how could it do it?
2008-11-17 15:07 uncategorized    ahh..or (per our eariler discussion) that is is Byte-addressable (where Byte=16 bits)
2008-11-17 15:07 geist            no no
2008-11-17 15:07 geist            byte == 8 bits
2008-11-17 15:08 geist            for the purpose of all our discussions
2008-11-17 15:08 uncategorized    ok
2008-11-17 15:08 uncategorized    so let me state how you would do it
2008-11-17 15:08 geist            you have a cpu that addresses 8 bits at a time
2008-11-17 15:08 geist            but you have word addressible memory
2008-11-17 15:08 geist            how could you do that?
2008-11-17 15:08 uncategorized    only one cpu?
2008-11-17 15:08 geist            yes
2008-11-17 15:08 uncategorized    or can we have two
2008-11-17 15:09 geist            no no, you're thinking far too hard
2008-11-17 15:09 geist            hint: you can read/write more than you need
2008-11-17 15:09 uncategorized    oh i think i got it
2008-11-17 15:10 uncategorized    so it needs 16 datalines and 2 rw lines, 31 address lines?
2008-11-17 15:10 geist            no, you're still thinking too hard
2008-11-17 15:10 geist            here's the answer: read a word, throw away the byte you dont want
2008-11-17 15:11 uncategorized    so the cpu must still have 16 datalines then
2008-11-17 15:11 geist            just beacuse the memory is 'wider' than you want to address doesn't mean you can't read the entire word and just figure out which part of it you actually wanted
2008-11-17 15:11 uncategorized    but you just toss out what you don't care about
2008-11-17 15:11 geist            right
2008-11-17 15:11 geist            so you can take it farhter
2008-11-17 15:11 uncategorized    so 16 datalines, 1 rw line, and 31 address lines
2008-11-17 15:11 geist            say you had 4GB, 32 bit wide memory chip
2008-11-17 15:11 uncategorized    and you toss out what you don't care about
2008-11-17 15:11 geist            30 address lines, 32 data lines
2008-11-17 15:11 geist            you can still bytewise address that, you just have to have a more complicated memory controller to throw away the parts you dont want
2008-11-17 15:12 geist            and then if you actually did do a 32bit fetch you get it all at once
2008-11-17 15:12 geist            make sense?
2008-11-17 15:12 uncategorized    i think so
2008-11-17 15:12 geist            this is a lot of times what they mean when they say the cpu is on a n bit bus
2008-11-17 15:12 geist            it's how much data it fetches at once
2008-11-17 15:13 uncategorized    the bus is "data lines"?
2008-11-17 15:13 uncategorized    or rw lines?
2008-11-17 15:13 geist            modern cpus are actually very wwide. they may actually only fetch in 128 or 256 bit widths
2008-11-17 15:13 geist            but the memory controller handles all the overfetching and overwriting, and the cpu still can address in byte boundaries
2008-11-17 15:14 geist            the bus is really a generic term for 'all that interconnect stuff that happens'
2008-11-17 15:14 uncategorized    so the datalines on the mem and cpu are at the end points
2008-11-17 15:14 geist            do you mean for real or in the highly generalized sense?
2008-11-17 15:14 uncategorized    i don't know enough to know what i mean
2008-11-17 15:14 uncategorized    so probably simple sense
2008-11-17 15:15 geist            simple sense, yes
2008-11-17 15:15 geist            pretend there's a single cpu and a single memory chip
2008-11-17 15:16 geist            just keep in mind that's now how it works at all
2008-11-17 15:16 geist            but it's a reasonable model for how it works
2008-11-17 15:16 uncategorized    good enough for me.
2008-11-17 15:16 uncategorized    if i ever get into the details, i can learn it then
2008-11-17 15:16 geist            and older stuff was actually pretty close to that model
2008-11-17 15:16 geist            20-25 years ago
2008-11-17 15:17 geist            or very simple designs nowadays for simple embedded stuff
2008-11-17 15:17 coly             /join 
2008-11-17 15:17 uncategorized    so a pointer is pointing to a physical memory address....a particular pattern on the address lines
2008-11-17 15:17 geist            yes
2008-11-17 15:18 geist            and thus the cpu tells the memory to fetch the data stored there
2008-11-17 15:18 uncategorized    when dereferenced....
2008-11-17 15:19 geist            right, when the cpu runs an instruction that fetches from that address
2008-11-17 15:20 uncategorized    and the pointer will require 1 byte if the cpu is byte addressable
2008-11-17 15:21 geist            right
2008-11-17 15:21 uncategorized    if 16-bit addressable, it will be larger
2008-11-17 15:21 geist            right
2008-11-17 15:21 geist            but most cpus are byte addressible
2008-11-17 15:21 uncategorized    why couldnt pointer use less than 1 byte
2008-11-17 15:21 geist            because then it wouldn't be byte addressible
2008-11-17 15:21 uncategorized    oh i see...almost a tautology
2008-11-17 15:22 geist            you could make a cpu that was less, but they dont usually exist
2008-11-17 15:22 geist            many cpus for many years had 6 bit bytes, 9 bit bytes, etc
2008-11-17 15:22 geist            but 8 became the standard
2008-11-17 15:22 geist            for pretty much everything
2008-11-17 15:22 geist            and there were some pretty modern cpus that weren't really byte addressible either
2008-11-17 15:23 geist            first generation or two of the Alpha, for example, couldn't address less than 64bits
2008-11-17 15:23 geist            memory addresses were still in bytes, but it had no instructions to load/store on anything less than 8 byte boundaries
2008-11-17 15:23 geist            so effectively the last 3 bits of the pointer were ignored
2008-11-17 15:23 uncategorized    interesting.
2008-11-17 15:24 uncategorized    so data lines determines the number of bits.
2008-11-17 15:24 sleepster        /join 
2008-11-17 15:24 uncategorized    typical 64-bit processor has 64 data lines then
2008-11-17 15:24 geist            uhh, not really
2008-11-17 15:24 geist            like i said before
2008-11-17 15:24 geist            the architecture defines what the programmer 'see's
2008-11-17 15:24 geist            'sees'
2008-11-17 15:24 uncategorized    like putting them in parallel, etc.
2008-11-17 15:24 geist            but how it's implemented can and frequently is different
2008-11-17 15:24 geist            but yes, effectively you could do that
2008-11-17 15:25 geist            that would be one solution, yes
2008-11-17 15:25 uncategorized    architecture within the processor?
2008-11-17 15:25 geist            there's a zillion different ways of doing it
2008-11-17 15:25 uncategorized    sure
2008-11-17 15:25 geist            no, the architecture being something like  x86, alpha, powerpc
2008-11-17 15:25 uncategorized    oh ok
2008-11-17 15:25 geist            the spec that the cpu follows, essentially
2008-11-17 15:25 geist            what the programmer sees
2008-11-17 15:25 uncategorized    so does the 32-bit place any constraints on the number of address lines?
2008-11-17 15:26 uncategorized    or is this an orthogonal decision
2008-11-17 15:26 geist            it's actually a different discussion
2008-11-17 15:26 geist            the amount of physical address any given architecture or cpu implementation can address can vary
2008-11-17 15:26 geist            which effectively increases the number of address lines that come out of the cpu
2008-11-17 15:27 geist            of course if you dont have enough memory to use them all up, you'll have address lines that go nowhere
2008-11-17 15:27 geist            which is a hole in memory
2008-11-17 15:27 uncategorized    but this is common right?
2008-11-17 15:27 geist            yes
2008-11-17 15:27 uncategorized    most people don't max out their system memory
2008-11-17 15:27 uncategorized    certainly not in 64-bit systesm
2008-11-17 15:27 geist            right, and x86s fr example, have been able to address more than 32bits for a while
2008-11-17 15:27 geist            36 bits, then 40, now 48 i believe
2008-11-17 15:28 uncategorized    with PAE?
2008-11-17 15:28 geist            with PAE and now x86-64
2008-11-17 15:29 geist            anywya, looks like you got the basics down
2008-11-17 15:30 uncategorized    yeah, thanks a bunch!
2008-11-17 15:30 geist            sure thing
2008-11-17 15:30 uncategorized    tantrika: same to you
2008-11-17 15:31 ccfreak2k        When did 48 come around?
2008-11-17 15:32 geist            think it may be just 40, probably depends on the implementation
2008-11-17 15:32 geist            number of physical bits is implementation defined in x86-64, i believe
2008-11-17 15:33 geist            page tables support up to 63

2008-11-17 19:03 elderK           and some API change?
2008-11-17 19:03 elderK           Was it Monotone or Mercurial?
2008-11-17 19:04 elderK           Forgive my memory :)
2008-11-17 19:04 ronny            we still use mercurial
2008-11-17 19:04 ronny            but we have git support
2008-11-17 19:04 ronny            monotone is moved to unsupported

2008-11-21 20:56 nully            heh lovely worthless currency. 
2008-11-21 20:57 nully            oh i was recently wondering.. are there many kernels out there that have the scheduler running on multiple cores?
2008-11-21 20:57 elderK           you mean managing multiple cores, or the scheduler itself being reentrant and active on several coreS?
2008-11-21 20:58 nully            the later yes.
2008-11-21 20:58 nully            say you have 8 cores, run it on 4 cores..
2008-11-21 20:59 elderK           Im not sure, tbh.
2008-11-21 20:59 elderK           I figure there must be?
2008-11-21 20:59 nully            mmm i would assume so. 
2008-11-21 20:59 elderK           no, definitely.
2008-11-21 20:59 elderK           there /would/ be.
2008-11-21 20:59 elderK           :)
2008-11-21 21:01 nully            if i ever get the time thats one part i would want to spend alot of time working on.
2008-11-21 21:01 elderK           hell yes.
2008-11-21 21:01 elderK           The idea of a totally reentrant system is just, awesome.
2008-11-21 21:01 elderK           totally threaded.

2008-11-21 21:02 elderK           that was one issue I was pondering over lately, actually.
2008-11-21 21:02 elderK           to do with Amethyst's module hotswappyness.
2008-11-21 21:02 elderK           What happens if several cores, try to access a module - while its being removed?
2008-11-21 21:02 nully            crash!
2008-11-21 21:02 elderK           an assosciate said id have to put a check in.
2008-11-21 21:02 elderK           but, I figured a better way
2008-11-21 21:02 elderK           :D
2008-11-21 21:02 nully            hehe
2008-11-21 21:02 elderK           :P If servers or whatever, userspace, calsl thsoe modules via system calls..
2008-11-21 21:02 elderK           :P just change the vector.
2008-11-21 21:03 elderK           or call gate or trap.
2008-11-21 21:03 elderK           make that atomic.

2008-11-22 22:19 ronny            there is a reason why i wouldnt ever dream of getting a laptop that has a non-intel card
2008-11-22 22:19 ronny            those are the only ones that dont yield weird issues
2008-11-22 22:20 nn               i fixed it by binding an unused ACPI key to run chvt 1
2008-11-22 22:20 nn               and loading radeonfb
2008-11-22 22:20 nn               so if i dont have X running on vt12, i smack the Access IBM button and get back to a vt that isnt in raw input mode from X

2008-11-27 10:36 TroyMartin       Just added a Turbo C page stub to the wiki, including how to get inline asm working with it (pain in the ass)
2008-11-27 10:36 _01000101_       Is that what your OS is compiled with?
2008-11-27 10:36 TroyMartin       no, mine's in 16-bit asm assembled with NASM
2008-11-27 10:37 tantrika         just need __asm{} blocks
2008-11-27 10:37 _01000101_       lol you just did the research for something unrelated to your own work? 
2008-11-27 10:38 TroyMartin       not just __asm{}, but you need to compile from the command line, use tiny model, and pass -Exxx to the compiler where xxx is the name of your assembler (in my case, nasm.exe)
2008-11-27 10:38 TroyMartin       and I've dipped my feet into TC before, it was kinda fun
2008-11-27 10:39 TroyMartin       TASM doesn't come with TC sadly.
2008-11-27 10:39 tantrika         ah right, small memory model isnt always neccessary depending, you can compile with -B or -S to generate the full assembly
2008-11-27 10:39 _01000101_       oh wow, that does seem like a pain for something so readily available in others (GCC).
2008-11-27 10:39 TroyMartin       if you go model tiny then exe2bin can strip out the exe headers, but anything else won't work with exe2bin
2008-11-27 10:39 tantrika         -B will run it through the assembler after compiling while -S will produce the ASM
2008-11-27 10:40 tantrika         ah
2008-11-27 10:41 tantrika         i had some trouble with BCC32 and inline asm.  BCC32 uses flat memory model and causes problems when mixing 16 & 32
2008-11-27 10:42 TroyMartin       TC is pure 16-bit so that problem isn't a problem :P
2008-11-27 10:42 tantrika         has to run the output through a series of sed commands then run it through the assembler
2008-11-27 10:42 tantrika         borland was the shit back in the day
2008-11-27 10:42 TroyMartin       lol
2008-11-27 10:43 TroyMartin       ROFL: the -S output makes NASM choke, but if you pass nasm.exe as the assembler for TC, it goes perfectly fine :P

2008-11-27 10:57 _01000101_       that should be interesting, see if you can make the syntax unique.
2008-11-27 10:58 TroyMartin       no yacc/lex for me, i feel up to doing it from scratch
2008-11-27 10:58 TroyMartin       and i'm thinking a mix of C and BASIC for the language.
2008-11-27 10:59 alboin           that's more complicated. You'd have to define your own language first, and not just a subset. 
2008-11-27 10:59 TroyMartin       right

2008-11-27 11:04 _01000101_       How widespread is IPv6?  I don't see it very often, but I hear about it a lot.  I'm thinking about furthering the implementation of it in my OS, but I'm not sure if the time+effort is worth it. 
2008-11-27 11:05 TroyMartin       Vista has v6 builtin, but I don't have a v6 router so I can't utilize it.
2008-11-27 11:05 tantrika         yea IDK what the deal is with it, it seems to be moving very slowly as an internet standard, i think its mostly used on large LANs
2008-11-27 11:06 _01000101_       That's what I mean, how many people 'really' have a IPv6 capable router/switch
2008-11-27 11:06 _01000101_       Even my cisco gear doesn't have IPv6 built-in.
2008-11-27 11:06 wcstok           well a switch wouldn't care about such things...openwrt knows ipv6 well enough heh
2008-11-27 11:07 _01000101_       Why wouldn't a switch care about IP addressing?
2008-11-27 11:07 wcstok           because that's not what switches do?
2008-11-27 11:07 _01000101_       Maybe an unmanaged switch, or a hub, but not a standard switch.
2008-11-27 11:08 _01000101_       Switches can still distribute and manage IP addresses. 
2008-11-27 11:08 _01000101_       They just don't care about WAN-related devices.

2009-01-30 12:15 Dr_Link          so, wcstok, if I manage to get myself a good strcmp function that returns 0 on a successful (true) comparison, how else would I tweak that code? I suppose changing the " to ' would be one first step.
2009-01-30 12:17 Math1s           my OS will use only strings where the length is stored before the actual pointer
2009-01-30 12:18 wcstok           well for starters you'd perform a string comparison instead of a pointer comparison -- c's == operator just compares the values of the pointers you operate on
2009-01-30 12:18 Dr_Link          hence why I need a working strcmp
2009-01-30 12:18 Dr_Link          but in all seriousness
2009-01-30 12:20 Dr_Link          once this part of the code works I'm nearly in the clear, I'll just need the following: substring support, a floppy controller (oh no, I have to tackle DMA), and a FAT12 driver
2009-01-30 12:21 Dr_Link          then I'll have version 0.1 ready
2009-01-30 12:21 Dr_Link          I tend to hold back. :/
2009-01-30 12:21 Math1s           eeeek
2009-01-30 12:21 Math1s           floppy support
2009-01-30 12:21 Dr_Link          what's wrong with it?
2009-01-30 12:21 Math1s           nobody uses floppy disks anymore
2009-01-30 12:22 Dr_Link          you're right
2009-01-30 12:22 Dr_Link          directly after floppy support I'll throw in some hard drive support
2009-01-30 12:22 wcstok           I used one last week =/
2009-01-30 12:22 Dr_Link          yeah, I use them all the time, actually
2009-01-30 12:22 Math1s           save your time and begin directly with harddisk support
2009-01-30 12:22 Dr_Link          I need a testbed machine first.
2009-01-30 12:22 Dr_Link          I also need a machine with SATA to learn about SATA support.
2009-01-30 12:22 wcstok           but then I was rescuing a motherboard from busted bios oblivion
2009-01-30 12:24 Dr_Link          heh
2009-01-30 12:25 Math1s           what you need to learn about it?
2009-01-30 12:25 Math1s           that it now has smaller cables?
2009-01-30 12:25 Math1s           or the plug&play support?

2009-01-30 12:26 Dr_Link          hot-swappability
2009-01-30 12:26 Math1s           if you're at this, also add pcie hotplugging
2009-01-30 12:26 Dr_Link          basically, I will need to poll each device node every minute (said interval can be changed) to see if it's still there
2009-01-30 12:26 Dr_Link          heh, pci-e
2009-01-30 12:26 Math1s           how about using IRQs?
2009-01-30 12:27 Dr_Link          that's done.
2009-01-30 12:27 Dr_Link          irq.c
2009-01-30 12:27 Math1s           for checking the device presence
2009-01-30 12:27 Dr_Link          well, if I can detect a floppy, I can detect a hard disk.
2009-01-30 12:28 Math1s           harddisks are different
2009-01-30 12:28 Dr_Link          I would suppose so
2009-01-30 12:28 Dr_Link          much less mechanics involved
2009-01-30 12:28 Dr_Link          I think my biggest obstacle will be getting multitasking.
2009-01-30 12:29 Math1s           software technically seen they are also different
2009-01-30 12:29 Dr_Link          but I desparately need sleep.
2009-01-30 12:29 Dr_Link          so I'm going to stop distracting myself now, so I can fix up strcmp and build another kernel tomorrow.
2009-01-30 12:29 wcstok           pfft, I even got multitasking working, back when I had motivation and time to work on my toy os
2009-01-30 12:29 Dr_Link          paging wasn't hard :/
2009-01-30 12:30 Dr_Link          I was scared of it at first
2009-01-30 12:30 Dr_Link          but holy shit, that was easy
2009-01-30 12:30 Math1s           its hard if you add *real* new features
2009-01-30 12:30 Dr_Link          like swap space?
2009-01-30 12:30 Math1s           like something noone ever implemented
2009-01-30 12:30 Math1s           like hot-updating
2009-01-30 12:30 Dr_Link          oooh.
2009-01-30 12:31 Dr_Link          I heard something about "page compression" a while back
2009-01-30 12:31 Math1s           updating software without restarting it
2009-01-30 12:31 Dr_Link          what's that all about?
2009-01-30 12:31 Math1s           what?
2009-01-30 12:31 Dr_Link          it's like someone took the standard for paging and mutilated the hell out of it
2009-01-30 12:31 Dr_Link          I don't know.
