<hochron> I have a xbox 360 connected to an xp box which I tweaked as a
          router.  This xp box is wirelessly connected to the internet.  I
          thought I needed a crossover cable and while looking for one I found
          an old router. What would be the quickest way to get on xbox live?

<dirkson> Hey all. Clearwire is selling 6mbit/s internet for $45 in my area, using wimax. (Wireless stuffs) Speakeasy sells the same speed, but through a
          wired connection, for $105. Based on speakeasy's reputation, I'm actually torn on which one to go for. I use SSH ALL THE TIME, but do very
          little else that might be latency-sensitive, and I only use about 30gb a month in bandwidth, well under even Clearwire's caps. I never call
          customer s  [13:44:32]
<simon> dirkson, I had Clearwire at 2mbps in Denmark and used it intensely with SSH. it sucked badly.  [13:48:27]
<simon> dirkson, also, all bandwidth tests rated my 2mbps/160kbps at 1mbps tops. when I complained and had them adjust my subscription to a 1mbps/160kbps
        line, my download effectively fell to 500kbps.  [13:49:13]
<dirkson> simon: Aye, but I wonder if it's not different out here. It's a brand new deployment, and it's sitting on top of a fiber network. So far,
          people are getting really decent speeds. (I.e. 7mbit/s). How was your latency to things? (I assume that was what made ssh difficult?)
                                                                                                                                                [13:50:13]
<simon> dirkson, the bandwidth they advertise is different from what you get, but that isn't really important for SSH since it uses very little. what
        really sucks is the latency.  [13:50:15]
<simon> yes  [13:50:32]
<simon> I think it depends more on the geometry of the surrounding architecture  [13:51:02]
<dirkson> simon: *nods* That would make sense.  [13:51:10]
<simon> than on the reliability of the backbone.  [13:51:11]
<simon> one inch would make a difference, and we literally had to duct tape the router to the upper corner of the window farthest in one direction.
                                                                                                                                                [13:51:45]
<dirkson> simon: I think I'll just get the guy to come out here, plug one in as a sample (He seemed friendly enough) and connect to the server I normally
          ssh to and /see/ what it's like.  [13:52:06]
<simon> if you can hack together a good antenna, I would say no problem. but with average equipment and much housing around you, it's a dead end.
                                                                                                                                                [13:52:31]
<simon> dirkson, yes, the great part with mobile broadband was actually moving it out of the house on occasion. :)  [13:53:01]
<dirkson> simon: Admittedly, since I'm currently on comcast's network, and comcast's local equipment is /broken/, I'm sure that even a carrier pidgin
          based tcp/ip setup would seem speedy by comparison, if the MTU was big enough ;)  [13:53:43]
<simon> dirkson, clearwire had a big advertisement boom that died out. now the USB dongles are winning market because they're actually portable (with
        regards to power supply, and don't require extra network cables)  [13:54:24]
<simon> (mind you I'm speaking from local experience.)  [13:54:43]
<dirkson> I'm getting 80ms pings from my router to comcast's closest router. That can't be normal.  [13:54:47]
<dirkson> *nods*  [13:54:52]
<dirkson> Well, I've already got a wasteful mobile internet device, so I'm mostly thinking for home use.  [13:55:17]
<simon> if you don't plan on moving soon, nothing beats cabled internet. you'd probably set up an access point anyway.  [13:55:43]
<dirkson> simon: Well, yes. My house is bathed in enough wifi to drown a horse : )  [13:56:14]
<simon> the *only* advantage there is to wimax-like solutions is portability, and only if you plan to make portable LANs (as opposed to just powering one
        laptop during public transportation) it makes sense over USB dongles.  [13:57:19]
<simon> and that's a fairly narrow use case  [13:57:42]
<simon> but still, it was pretty cool. I made some hackathons at a squatted house once :)  [13:58:06]
<dirkson> *thinks* I could find a use for that, if I had it. "Well, time to go to my friend's house. Better bring my internet along."  [13:58:33]
<simon> but accepting high latency is a bit easier when you have to accept broken toilets.  [13:58:40]
<dirkson> Point  [13:58:47]
<simon> dirkson, assuming your friend doesn't have internet.  [13:58:59]
<simon> dirkson, also, if your school network is run by nazis, bringing your own along is kind of provocative. :)  [13:59:21]
<simon> dirkson, but even then, I'd prefer an OpenVPN solution.  [13:59:36]
<dirkson> Well, some of my friends are still living under 512kb/s dialup. That'd help. It'd also be neat to be able to take my internet to my uncle's
          house when I fix his computer. Did you know that they still sell dialup in MAJOR CITIES?  [14:00:10]
<chalco> 512Kbps is not dialup  [14:00:56]
<dirkson> chalco: Two separate people- Friend, with 512kbps, uncle, with OH GOD WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO YOURSELF?!  [14:02:35]
<chalco> "512kb/s dialup"  [14:02:55]
<dirkson> Oh! Right. Sorry. I meant DSL.  [14:03:25]
<chalco> ah  [14:03:33]
<MaxHeadroom> Hello, am running an asus wl-520gu, using wpa-auto-personal and tkip+aes, sometimes when using my winxp toshiba laptop, I will loose the
              connection, and then notice that my router isn't even available, only way to get it back is to disable the routers  radio, then re-enable
              it.  How can I fix this?  [14:04:55]
<whistler> firmware  [14:08:46]
<MaxHeadroom> whistler: the router is running the latest asus firmware, did you mean using unofficial firmware? or the laptops wifi card firmware?
                                                                                                                                                [14:15:02]
<whistler> i meant router firmware, but it could be wifi  [14:15:29]
<whistler> card that is  [14:15:48]
<MaxHeadroom> the only newer wifi card firmware I can fine is on the czech atheros site, or on opendrivers.com, not sure if they would be ok  [14:18:54]
<MaxHeadroom> whistler: any other ideas?  I will try installing one of those other wifi card firmwares, which ever is newest, if there isn't something
              else to try, such as a setting in the router setups btw, the router is G, as is the laptop  [14:35:50]
<Miller`> MaxHeadroom: updating the router firmware sounds like a good idea. http://sourceforge.net/projects/madwifi/ is the opensource atheros driver
                                                                                                                                                [14:36:41]
<Miller`> oh wait, windowss ok, ignore the 2nd part of that  [14:37:11]
<whistler> no  [14:38:35]
<MaxHeadroom> the asus router firmware is uptodate on official, I was thinking of trying dd-wrt, which I have never used before, but didn't think that
              would be needed just to make the router more reliable
<whistler> other than maybe backing down your firmware?  [14:38:50]
<whistler> do you have another system to test with the router?  [14:39:23]
<MaxHeadroom> not really, my other laptop has a B card only  [14:39:49]
<MaxHeadroom> and the issue is not consistent, I don't really know when it will happen  [14:40:40]
<whistler> does rebooting the laptop work, or only rebooting the router?  [14:41:18]
<MaxHeadroom> rebooting the laptop doesn't help  [14:43:25]
<MaxHeadroom> and I don't need to reboot the router, just going into setup, disabling wireless, then re-enabling  [14:43:55]
<whistler> same diff  [14:44:22]
<whistler> but i think its gotta be some firware issue  [14:44:29]
<MaxHeadroom> well, if thats true then my only option is to take the dd-wrt plunge, was wanting to try it sometime to see about doing a chillispot
                                                                                                                                                [14:49:32]
<Ficthe> hi, silly question- I notice on IRC some users' ip address is displayed (i.e., x.x.x.x; x=1-255), and some users' hostname is displayedi what's
         the difference? and is that something the user has control over, if so, how?  [14:50:55]
