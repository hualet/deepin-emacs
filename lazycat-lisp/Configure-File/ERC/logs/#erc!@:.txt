<taruti> Is there some magic way of setting erc-prompt so that it would take erc-default-target and work upon joining new channels? Currently it seems
         that when joining a new channel erc-default-target is nil, but after pressing enter erc-prompt is updated with the expected channel name.
                                                                                                                                                [10:19:14]
