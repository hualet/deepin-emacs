<ggonzalez> morning  [16:40:52]
<JackScott> Good morning  [16:41:59]
<ggonzalez> hi JackScott  [16:43:07]
<JackScott> How are you?  [16:43:38]
<ggonzalez> fine and yourslef  [16:51:34]
<ggonzalez> ?
<JackScott> Yeah pretty good  [16:51:38]
<ggonzalez> that's cool  [16:51:51]
<JackScott> One more day to go until the weekend. Almost there.  [16:52:15]
<ggonzalez> I hate weekens  [16:52:44]
<ggonzalez> weekends  [16:52:47]
<JackScott> ?!  [16:55:18]
<JackScott> That's scary  [16:55:23]
<JackScott> I live for them  [16:55:25]
<ggonzalez> the absence of the daily routine plunge me into a deep hole of sleepiness  [17:02:57]
<JackScott> Fair enough. That's what I like best, though.  [17:03:11]
<JackScott> Not having to get up at 7am makes me a happy man.  [17:03:20]
<ggonzalez> heh  [17:03:34]
<ggonzalez> yeah, my problem is that I overload the weekend with too much work if I sleep too much I can't complete all the stuff and enter the
            self-upseting world  [17:06:15]
<JackScott> Ah. That can be a problem.  [17:06:51]
