<maasha> Chris: my fault.  [15:16:37]
<maasha> my c book is several thousand kms away :o/  [15:16:48]
<maasha> so is there a way to test if stdin is empty?  [15:21:14]
<maasha> or rather - I want to print usage information if no input is in stdin  [15:21:51]
<maasha> oh, darn, I have to run  [15:24:30]
<pragma_> http://howto-pages.org/shootfoot.php  [15:45:29]
<pragma_> epic.  [15:45:31]
<pragma_> much better than the original  [15:45:58]
<pragma_> !gamers is http://infovore.org/talks/if-gamers-ran-the-world/  [16:42:46]
<vasoq> is there an easy way to put the integer representation of "101" in the first 4 chars of a string?  my first way of doing it was just do "101\0"
        but the string is longer than 4 and when sending over a socket it won't read past the '\0'  [16:46:09]
<pragma_> :o  [16:47:47]
<Spider-Pork> hi, I am using copy_to_user kernel function, there is a limit on number of transfer byte?  [16:49:42]
<Chris> try irc://irc.oftc.net/#kernelnewbies  [16:50:07]
<Spider-Pork> thank you  [16:50:15]
<Chris> vasoq: eh?  [16:50:26]
<further> vasoq: snprintf ?  [16:51:53]
<further> vasoq: snprintf(char *str, 4, "%d", integer); does this help?  [16:53:05]
<further> int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, s);  [16:53:19]
<further>  
<Chris> the question suggests vasoq is more confused than merely needing snprintf  [16:54:15]
<dmb> is there no bool datatype in c?  [16:54:22]
<Chris> there is _Bool in C99  [16:54:40]
<Chris> which <stdbool.h> provides a typedef of bool to it.  [16:54:49]
<dmb> oh  [16:55:01]

<pizza_> heh  [10:01:04]
<SimoneB> i'm starting to think that there's something wrong with glib, something doesn't behave like the docs say  [10:01:59]
<Zhivago> Skapare: That struct declaration form would forbid anonymous structs.  [10:02:28]
<Zhivago> The glib are often like that.  [10:03:59]
<SimoneB> sreally?  [10:06:25]
<SimoneB> in the end that code just uses 3 functions from glib, i could as well try to rewrite thems  [10:07:14]
<Eno_> i have a call to a function getch, which only seems to exist in ncursesi is there such a function in windows environments?  [10:07:58]
<Zhivago> Yes, from memory it is called getch()  [10:08:56]
<SimoneB> Eno_: that should be in conio.h, include it  [10:09:02]
<SimoneB> Eno_: hum, i've just read that conio.h is non standard  [10:09:41]
<Zhivago> There is also a port of curses to windows/dos, iirc.  [10:09:43]
<Eno_> trying to grade a program, and they called this function, and i have no idea what it is.  [10:09:45]
<Eno_> so it doesn't compile  [10:09:53]
<Zhivago> Yes, conio.h is non-standard, just like [n]curses s  [10:09:56]
<Zhivago> Eno: It exactly the same as getchar() in unix.  [10:10:13]
<gfarfl> SimoneB: try free'ing the list before you unlock the mutex  [10:10:19]
<Eno_> i replaced it with getchar.  [10:10:20]
<SimoneB> gfarfl: yes, that way it works, but why?  [10:10:34]
<Zhivago> Eno: You may want to put the terminal into non-canonical mode m stty -a may be useful here.  [10:10:43]
<SimoneB> gfarfl: in this case I could afford to call free() inside the critical section, but in a real program I would do some serious processing before
          free()ing, and that woudln't be good  [10:11:19]
<Zhivago> Well, I guess it depends on if you're in delay mode or not.  [10:11:28]
<srg2000> Eno_: do you grade in the same environment the students work on?  [10:11:40]
<Eno_> srg2000: they are using dev c++ on windows, which uses a version of gcc. I'm using gcc on linux. this is the first time i've wondered whether that
       could be a problem  [10:12:31]
<twkm> Eno_: pd-curses.  [10:12:37]
<Tim-S> this is a bit off topic but I hope someone can answer.  After running a very compulationally intensive program, the computer exhibits signs of
        being slow for a few seconds _after_ my program complete.  Is that because everything that was in the processer cache has been cleared out?
                                                                                                                                                [10:13:06]
<pizza_> Tim-S: how much RAM does the process use?  [10:13:34]
<Eno_> however, the file is only including some standard headers  [10:13:36]
<Eno_> stdio.h  [10:13:41]
<srg2000> yeah, I'd look at the ram usage first  [10:13:42]
<srg2000> Tim-S: is this a C program?  [10:13:47]
<SimoneB> Tim-S: it's probably because of memory swapping to disk, and swapping back to memory when the process ends  [10:13:50]
<twkm> Eno_: curses isn't a standard header.  consider using pd-curses, which should make your life easier.  [10:14:00]
<pizza_> Tim-S: the processor cache gets repopulated at a much smaller interval  [10:14:02]
<Eno_> it doesn't include curses  [10:14:13]
<Tim-S> srg: yeah, I'm playing around with optimizing matrix multiplication and I run ran my program with very large matrices.  [10:14:53]
<Tim-S> pizza_: I'm not sure, how can i check?  [10:15:01]
<srg2000> Tim-S: how big a matrix?  [10:15:05]
<Zhivago> tim: Does your hard-drive rattle during this period?  [10:15:07]
<twkm> Eno_: pd-curses most certainly does, as it is a portable curses implementation.  [10:15:14]
<Tim-S> srg2000: that time was with a 10,000000x10,000000 matrix of doubles  [10:15:51]
<Tim-S> *doubles  [10:15:56]
<srg2000> Tim-S: hahaha  [10:15:58]
<SimoneB> Tim-S: which OS are you using? use the windows task manager or "top" on *nix  [10:16:21]
<Tim-S> so pretty much that operation destroys anything that was in RAM for other programs and needs time to recover after it's finished?  [10:17:08]
<Zhivago> Tim: Um, so that would be 800 terabytes of memory?  [10:17:15]
<srg2000> Tim-S: I doubt it could be 10000000x10000000 unless this is a sparse matrix  [10:17:25]
<Tim-S> actually I wasn't multiplying them yet, just allocating a matrix that large  [10:17:32]
<twkm> Tim-S: sounds like a reasonable explanation.  [10:17:36]
<srg2000> Zhivago: yep, per my calculations as well  [10:17:54]
<Eno_> i have replaced the call with a scanf, and it is working better now  [10:18:09]
<Tim-S> so I guess it would be a bad idea to actually run the matrix calculation with that large of a matrix :-p  [10:18:13]
<Zhivago> Tim: What are you smoking, btw?  [10:18:18]
<twkm> Tim-S: depends on the amount of memory you have available.  [10:18:42]
<Eno_> however, it seems this program is totally nonfunctioning, and i doubt if it even compiled on their machine :p  [10:18:43]
<Tim-S> Zhivago: nothing, I don't have any homework so I'm playing around with optimization  [10:18:56]
<Tim-S> although this might be highly entertaining if I was smoking something  [10:19:09]
<twkm> if you have around 727 terabytes of memory available, it should be fine.  [10:19:20]
<Tim-S> hahaha  [10:19:29]
<Zhivago> Tim: So, you have 800 terabytes of memory?  [10:19:37]
<srg2000> Tim-S: xdim * ydim * 8 = bytes s 10^3 = KB ... 10^6 = MB ... 10^9 = GB ... 10^12 = TB  [10:19:44]
<twkm> that's if double's are 8 bytes.  might be 16.  [10:19:59]
<twkm> (though 8 does seem a fair guess)  [10:20:11]
<Tim-S> Zhivago: I don't, I just tried to allocate an array that large. I didn't multiply yet  [10:20:14]
<srg2000> twkm: good point  [10:20:18]
<srg2000> Tim-S: you can't allocate that amount either  [10:21:05]
<Zhivago> Tim: Turn off overcommit.  [10:21:10]
<Tim-S> srg2000: well it fails with terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::bad_alloc' what():  std::bad_alloc  [10:21:28]
<Chris> it's closer to 728 than 727.  [10:21:33]
<Tim-S> so I assume it's stoping me?  [10:21:36]
<Chris> ah, not C :)  [10:21:47]
<pizza_> ##c++ would know  [10:21:48]
<srg2000> Chris: 727.595  [10:21:56]
<Chris> srg: yes  [10:22:01]
<Tim-S> yeah it's in C++, I figured it would be safer :-p  [10:22:07]
<chaplja|> Tim-S: do you understand how much memory you're trying to allocate  [10:22:14]
<Tim-S> but I figured C guys would know more about the OS  [10:22:15]
<Zhivago> A good sign of a confused person is that he doesn't know what language he's using.  [10:22:18]
<Chris> srg: 727.59576141834259033203125 to be precise.  [10:22:21]
<Tim-S> chaplja|: yes
<twkm> Tim-S: feh.  [10:22:23]
<Tim-S> Zhivago: I wasn't confused about the language  [10:22:34]
<SimoneB> srg2000: too bad i have just 727.548  [10:22:37]
<srg2000> Chris: rofl, yeah that is what my calc says also  [10:22:45]
<chaplja|> Tim-S: so what are you wondering about  [10:22:46]
<Tim-S> I wanted to ask an Operating Systems question and ##c is the logical choice  [10:22:55]
<Chris> srg: well, I'd be surprised if it said otherwise.
<Zhivago> tim: As opposed to #operating-systems or some-such?  [10:23:00]
<Tim-S> chaplja|: can you not school up to see my original question?  [10:23:05]
<Tim-S> *scroll  [10:23:11]
<Zhivago> tim: Cut back on the ganja m it's doing you no favours.  [10:23:12]
<srg2000> Tim-S: there are packages for doing distributed matrixes if you have access to a super-computer
<pizza_> Tim-S: you are pushing all other programs' memory into swap with your enormous allocations; when your program ends, they are swapped back into
         memory  [10:23:27]
<srg2000> Tim-S: www.top500.org, see if you can get one of these for a few hours  [10:23:29]
<srg2000> *matrices  [10:23:43]
<Tim-S> pizza_: yeah, makes sense  [10:23:49]
<pizza_> 10mx10ms interesting. may i ask what you're calculating?  [10:24:00]
<tekhneek> is there an obj c channel?  [10:24:28]
<twkm> tekhneek: yes.  [10:24:34]
<tekhneek> #?  [10:24:57]
<twkm> ask #help, or alis.  [10:25:12]
<twkm> or read our web page.  [10:25:18]
<Tim-S> pizza_ the plan is to play around with optimization (right now I've got loop unrolling, loop tiling, and a few other tricks).  But I don't
        actually need that large of an array.  I just wanted to understand what would happen to the operating system when it tries an unreasonable
        calculation  [10:25:52]
<Zhivago> tim: You really are off your head.  [10:26:22]
<pizza_> which OS?  [10:26:27]
<Tim-S> Linux  [10:26:30]
<Zhivago> tim: Why do you think that any of that constitutes an 'unreasonable calculation'?  [10:26:32]
<twkm> hmm, one of those channels has disappeared.  [10:26:45]
<Tim-S> Zhivago: plently of people have already mentioned why it's unreasonable (for a commodity computer at least)  [10:27:02]
<twkm> Tim-S: asking ##linux about linux is probably useful.  [10:27:14]
<Zhivago> Tim: No-one has said that it is an 'unreasonable calculation'  [10:27:23]
<pizza_> Tim-S: you will soon become acquainted with the "oom killer"  [10:27:33]
<Zhivago> Tim: They have said that it is a 'stupid thing to do'.
<Tim-S> Zhivago: so example how it's reasonable to perform on a commodity computer?  [10:27:58]
<Zhivago> Tim: There are no unreasonable calculations involved in attempting to allocate more memory than you have. It's quite straight-forward.
                                                                                                                                                [10:27:59]
<Zhivago> Tim: Which part of that memory allocation do you think involves an unreasonable calculation?  [10:28:21]
<Tim-S> tkwm: the signal to noise ratio in linux is unfortunate, but I can take it there if you think it's too offtopic  [10:28:48]
<pizza_> trying to allocate more memory than you have disk space is fairly unreasonable  [10:29:05]
<Zhivago> pizza: Is that a calculation?  [10:29:30]
<Zhivago> pizza: In any case, that's simply gibberish.  [10:29:51]
<pizza_> you're free to go on endlessly about terminology, but i understand his point  [10:29:57]
<Zhivago> pizza: He needs to start expressing himself like someone who hasn't been huffing gasoline for the last ten years.  [10:30:31]
<pizza_> not everyone is as eloquent as yourself  [10:31:14]
<Tim-S> Zhivago: it was a bad choice of words; easier to address it directory than in your roundabout fashion.  Useless words might be worse than
        incorrect ones. :-)  [10:31:24]
<Tim-S> *directly  [10:31:29]
<pizza_> though i do understand your point  [10:31:40]
<twkm> Tim-S: since you are writing c++ at the least i'd suggest ##c++  [10:31:49]
<Tim-S> Zhivago: but how about trying to calculate which memory address too store in <diskspace> + one double.  That seems unreasonable to me  [10:32:31]
<Tim-S> *to
<srg2000> Tim-S: this isn't really a productive discussion  [10:33:05]
<Tim-S> srg2000: agreed  [10:33:34]
<Zhivago> Tim: What the hell does diskspace have to do with it?  [10:33:39]
<Zhivago> Tim: Get away from that petrol can.  [10:33:54]
<srg2000> I like it when people ask amusing C questions  [10:39:59]
<Xgc> Tim-S: Even this computer might not satisfy your memory requirements: http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/11/supercomputers.html  [10:40:33]
<Skapare> srg2000: how about abusing C statements?  [10:40:41]
<SimoneB> a KiB is 1000 bytes or 1024?
<Skapare> srg2000:    ptr = & ptr;  [10:40:51]
<Zhivago> Simone: 1024.  [10:41:17]
<srg2000> Skapare: it doesn't count when you do it, it has to be genuine  [10:42:52]
* SimoneB invokes valgrind  [10:46:25]
<sweetgum> is there a way i can read until eof with fread?  [10:58:09]
<SimoneB> while( !feof(filehandle) ) fread(s)  [11:02:08]
<Chris> hmm, I don't have a C89 draft handyi %lf in printf is undefined right? I know that it's treated as %f in C99.  [11:05:19]
<Zhivago> I think that most implementations are permissive, but it is technically illegal.  [11:06:06]
<Chris> thanks  [11:06:12]
<SimoneB> ok, so, my program with standard glib functions (any of the 3 functions I needed): segfault  [11:07:49]
<SimoneB> my program with the 3 functions written by me: works!  [11:07:58]
<Chris> and?  [11:10:05]
<SimoneB> and, i guess that glib apis don't really work like in the docs  [11:11:33]
<srg2000> SimoneB: are the ones you used supposed to be thread-safe?  [11:12:05]
<SimoneB> they are supposed to work on different stuff when not inside mutexes, this should count as thread-safe s i think  [11:13:05]
<SimoneB> enough coding, it's 4am s good night  [11:14:41]
<srg2000> 10PM here :-D  [11:14:57]
<Chris> you guys are in one of those weird time zones offset 14 minutes from the hour?  [11:15:54]
<srg2000> I'm sorry, I meant to say it is Thu Dec  4 22:16:16.423 EST 2008  [11:16:49]
<Chris> your clock is about 35 seconds slow  [11:17:14]
<srg2000> Chris: are you sure?  [11:17:44]
<Chris> well, either that or you took the time from your clock, then pasted it 35 seconds later, or (unlikely), it took 35 seconds for the message to
        reach me  [11:18:13]
<srg2000> Chris: probably some combination of those things, is your clock accurate?  [11:18:44]
<Chris> to within a hundred milliseconds or so  [11:19:14]
<srg2000> Chris: what do you sync again?  [11:19:23]
<srg2000> *against  [11:19:53]
<Chris> depends which machine  [11:20:26]
<Chris> ntp.connect.com.au: stratum 2, offset -0.000077, synch distance 0.035525 for example, which syncs to murgon.csse.unimelb.edu.au: stratum 1,
        offset 0.000019, synch distance 0.000833, refid 'GPS'  [11:21:10]
<Chris> So for example, the time here is Fri Dec 5 11:22:55 SGT 2008  [11:22:52]
<srg2000> Chris: the times on this machine are within fractions of a second of nist.time.gov  [11:23:47]
<srg2000> Chris: I was just probably slow in pasting  [11:24:03]
<Chris> ah right  [11:24:19]
<srg2000> Chris: I'm not rooted on here anyway :-)  [11:24:46]
<Chris> time.nist.gov: stratum 1, offset 0.000000, synch distance 0.002650, refid 'ACTS'  [11:25:27]
<Chris> hmm, it's quite far away  [11:26:05]
<srg2000> Chris: I think it is in North America  [11:27:02]
<Chris> yes, the machine I IRC from is in north america  [11:27:51]
<Chris> i get 16ms ping times to it  [11:28:00]
<Chris> it seems to be in colorado, perhaps  [11:29:13]
<srg2000> Boulder, CO, US  [11:29:16]
<Chris> i think my machine is in Texas  [11:29:24]
<b0ne> it's just up the road from my house :P  [11:29:29]
<Eekdacat> i have to make this person's program into a distributed program  [11:31:38]
<Eekdacat> and they coded it as an absolute mess  [11:31:50]
<Eekdacat> why would anyone ever use verbose, fprintf to stderr, fprintf to somewhere else, and printf  [11:33:04]
<Eekdacat> oh wait no they use verbose, perror, fprintf to stderr  [11:33:33]
<Eekdacat> In function `process':  [11:40:07]
<Eekdacat> : undefined reference to `error'
<apples`> you have an undefined reference to error, there  [11:42:13]
<Eekdacat> no kidding  [11:43:37]
<Eekdacat> the person who coded this picks the most obscure places to put brackets
<Eekdacat> }else{
