<salex> grad students & collaborators typically.  many math grad students
        can't code their way out of a wet paper bag at first  [03:40:56]

<Dynetrekk_> salex: yeah, I know. I'm a physics student, but they're the same,
             often.  [03:41:33]
<dcrawford> if they can't code at all, might as well teach them lisp :)
                                                                     [03:41:41]
<sgware> QUESTION ABOUT SBCL LISP (I think): I have written a shell script
         'script.sh' that runs a lisp program 'prog_1.lisp'.  The lisp program
         loads a file via (load file) called 'input.lisp'.  Everything works
         fine when I run the shell script directly from a console.  However,
         when I run the shell script from within a Ruby program, prog_1.lisp
         only reads in part of input.lisp.  In Windows, it only reads in the
         first 3833 characters, and   [03:41:43]
<dcrawford> (all caps BAD)  [03:42:13]
<sgware> sorry  [03:42:21]
<schme> That's a bit perverse calling lisp from inside ruby :)  [03:42:22]
<salex> dcrawford: I am, where I can.  Otoh, they're not all mine to steer
                                                                     [03:42:23]
<sgware> I knows haha  [03:42:31]
<dcrawford> ruby calling shell calling lisp  [03:42:48]
<sgware> Trying to get lisp and ruby to play with each other is proving quite
         difficult

* schme is curious if it runs ok when called from some other language.
<dcrawford> is the answer don't run on windows :P ?  [03:43:50]
<schme> say like lisp or something.  [03:43:57]
<sgware> In linux it reads in the first 3621 characters of input.lisp, whereas
         in windows it reads in 3833  [03:43:59]
<tic> salex, about not being able to code your way out of a wet paper bagi is
      that a trend that seems to be rising even in computer science undergrad
      programs? (I sometimes get that feeling.)  [03:44:16]
*** #lisp modes: +nc  [03:44:17]
*** #lisp was created on ‘ÐÇ‘ÆÚ‘Ò» 2003/08/04 05‘Ê±30‘·Ö32‘Ãë
<rsynnott> adn your script just does 'sbcl mload bla.lisp' or similar?
                                                                     [03:44:26]
<dcrawford> is input.lisp a generated or preexisting file?  [03:44:31]
<sgware> It just cuts off the file mid-lines and I have no idea why
<sgware> yes  [03:44:39]
<Dynetrekk_> tic: it could be this simple: more people get an education these
             days. it must inevitably "lower the level".  [03:44:50]
<schme> tic: That seems to very much be the case.
<dcrawford> sgware, that was an either or  [03:44:55]
<salex> Dynetrekk_: not a bad start for general stuff available:
        http://www.cliki.net/index  [03:44:56]
<sgware> sbcl mnoinform --noprint --disable-debugger --load "input.lisp"
                                                                     [03:45:07]
<rsynnott> tic: probably more in CS than elsewhere; a lot of 'CS' courses have
           shifted towards business-oriented stuff rather than actual cs
                                                                     [03:45:11]
<Dynetrekk_> salex: great  [03:45:15]
<hefner_> tic: wouldn't that be terrible? complete a computer science degree,
          and not only have not learned any math or anything useful, but still
          can't code your way out of a wet paper bag?  [03:45:16]
<schme> one thing I can say for sure is that it also holds true for
        pol. sci. students.  [03:45:18]
<salex> for numerical stuff I use a) a bunch I've written (stochastic process
        stuff, things that don't turn up in libraries much, etc.) b) stuff
        from the old cmu repostiory (should be a pointer at cliki)  [03:45:37]
<rsynnott> (so the products can probably use BrandName web framework, but are
           less likely to know how a cache works, say)  [03:45:43]
<sgware> dcrawford:  Hmm?  Sorry, I didn't understand the question.  [03:45:54]
<salex> c) some c/fortran/whatever libraries (you can do this from lisp, it's
        not as seamless as python but not bad, typically  [03:46:08]
<salex> d) bits and bobs picked up who knows where  [03:46:21]
<rsynnott> I was in the last year at college to be exposed to scary things
           like languages other than C++ and Java  [03:46:33]
<Dynetrekk_> salex: I sees and for running lisp? CLISP? some compiler?
                                                                     [03:46:38]
<dcrawford> does the ruby or something write the input.lisp file (basically is
            it possibly a multithreading issue (file not done being
            created/written to disk before being read)  [03:46:42]
<p_l> tic: I'm only in first year, but many people here had problem with our
      first assignments  [03:46:52]
<rsynnott> since then, they've also dropped compiler design as a mandatory
           course, and dropped most logic design stuff almost entirely
                                                                     [03:47:02]
<p_l> tic: Which was basically written for you, you only needed to transform
      it into code  [03:47:20]
<salex> some of this is going to depnd on how much performance you need.  the
        hand tuned stuff and thinks like ATLAS or FFTW (autotuned) will beat
        good native implementations in pretty much any language  [03:47:32]
<hefner_> rsynnott: no worries, if it happens that compiler design was mostly
          about parsing =p
<sgware> Nope.  The file finishes writing before running the script.  I can
         cat the file and it's all theres also, it always reads in the same
         arbitrary number of characters.  [03:47:35]
<salex> so if you actually need that, link it  [03:47:37]
<salex> otherwise, there is stuff around  [03:47:41]
<rsynnott> hefner_: the mandatory third year version was  [03:47:46]
<rsynnott> the optional fourth year version wasn't  [03:47:57]
<rsynnott> now, of course, the optional fourth year version is, due to absense
           of any sort of compiler design in third year  [03:48:17]
<tic> hefner_, it would indeed be terrible.  (Were you being sarcastic?)
                                                                     [03:48:18]
<hefner_> tic: I'm not sure.  [03:48:28]
<Dynetrekk_> salex: I see. that's why I like the scipy stuff; it has all these
             libraries, they're fast, and so ons  [03:48:29]
<hefner_> I think computer science is stupid, and people ought to be warned
          away from it.  [03:48:46]
<rsynnott> (they replaced it with a strange thing that can't decide if it's a
           business class or a psychology class, mandatory, naturally)
                                                                     [03:48:50]
<tic> Dynetrekk_, more people - lower level:  I don't know if I'm actually
      seeing more people, rather the opposite actually.  More people seek into
      softer IT educations, where you (as schme noted) don't do much
      "hardcore" things.  [03:49:12]
<salex> Dynetrekk_: yeah, that's fine if what you need is in the standar libs
                                                                     [03:49:15]
<hefner_> rsynnott: how about an ethics class? =p  [03:49:18]
<tic> hefner_, on what accounts do you find CS stupid?  [03:49:26]
<tic> Dynetrekk_, uhm, as rsynnott noted.  [03:49:40]
<salex> Dynetrekk_: so again, it depends what you're doing  [03:49:41]
<Dynetrekk_> salex: exactlys  [03:49:43]
<p_l> CS should be hard, not a 'learn to code in Java' course  [03:50:07]
<rsynnott> p_l: arguable; there's room for vocational education  [03:50:39]
<Dynetrekk_> tic: more people than in the 70s at any rate. and people don't
             like hard work and hard stuff any more.  [03:50:40]
<rsynnott> it's be unusual to teach plumbers fluid dynamics, for instance
                                                                     [03:50:55]
<tic> p_l, for some people it takes time for things to click.  I remember
      learning doubly-indirected pointers when I was 12 or so. Took me ages.
      I suppose it's the same but at university but with a lot of
      stress. Also, it might be that some people aren't supposed to learn (or
      aren't very motivated to learn)  [03:51:03]
<rsynnott> Dynetrekk_: that's a myth, closely related to the 'good old days'
           one  [03:51:09]
<tic> rsynnott, there's much inflation in education. Nowadays, it seems to be
      a requirement to understand fluid dynamics to play Mario.  [03:51:32]
<rsynnott> tic: oddly, a lot of people seem to be incabable of figuring out
           pointers at all  [03:51:59]
<Dynetrekk_> rsynnott: it is? I'm not saying that the old days were good.
                                                                     [03:52:01]
<rsynnott> ever  [03:52:02]
<tic> rsynnott, perhaps the pointers are hooked up to boring things, like
      integers and characters?  [03:52:29]
<p_l> rsynnott: It would be nice if we got pointer arithmetic :)
<Dynetrekk_> rsynnott: you have to use it enough. I didn't understand it in my
             java course. when I fiddled enough around with C, I had no
             problems understanding the concept, at least.  [03:52:40]
<Dynetrekk_> tic: you want something like: nakedwoman* n;  [03:52:59]
<p_l> tic: When it takes a long time for you to crank a set of code that
      follows pseudocode written for you in the assignmenth  [03:53:03]
<tic> p_l, it's that magic threshold before you "get" loops, conditionals,
      assignment and similar basic programming language constructs that does
      it, I guess. Some people probably never cross that barrier.  [03:53:57]
<p_l> tic: The fun thing, this assignment didn't need loops nor conditionals
      at all  [03:54:33]
* tic feels like he's talking out of his rear.  [03:54:34]
<dlowe> yes, we are the illuminated ones, set apart from others by our MASSIVE
        brains
<dcrawford> and once you get why lisp macros are the 'true magic' then lisp is
            obvious :P  [03:54:37]
<tic> dlowe, yeah, I was starting to feel silly.  [03:54:55]
<p_l> anyway, the use of such assignment was stupid IMHO - we need to teach
      how to think, not how to write some stuff in Java with a lot of
      hand-waving  [03:55:32]
<rsynnott> the odd bit is that a lot of colleges now seem to be teaching
           people to do things that they could learn for themselves very, very
           easily  [03:58:10]
<tic> rsynnott, API juggling?  [03:58:29]
<hefner_> tic: rather than veer off into an unproductive rant, I'll just note
          my impression that virtually anything I could've studied other than
          computer science would have been a more productive use of my time,
          even if I never used any of it (math, physics, ee, ce, me, anything)
                                                                     [03:58:40]
<p_l> rsynnott: That's my point.  [03:58:41]
<rsynnott> tic: indeed  [03:59:08]
<rsynnott> hefner_: that's likely  [03:59:38]
<rsynnott> I really regret not doing maths at this point  [03:59:50]
<Dynetrekk_> maths is invaluable in my opinion  [04:00:34]
<Dynetrekk_> other stuff, you can learn  [04:00:40]
<tic> hefner_, *nod* thanks for sharing.  [04:01:10]
<rsynnott> also, 'games development' courses; grr :P  [04:02:04]
<hefner_> heh  [04:02:10]
<rsynnott> (impressively pointless in practice, but becoming very popular)
                                                                     [04:02:27]
<Dynetrekk_> rsynnott: do you know what these courses actually teach? I'm just
             curious  [04:02:49]
* rsynnott used to work for a games development company (a bit of Activision);
  shockingly, everyone had maths or CS degrees and not weird games development
  ones  [04:03:05]
<rsynnott> Dynetrekk_: most of them seem to be a games oriented equivalent of
           the vocational computer programming ones  [04:03:58]
<rsynnott> so, stitch a big pile of APIs together and you get a game, rather
           than a CMS  [04:04:19]
<tic> rsynnott, games development courses = math courses, in practice.  the
      amount of matrix juggling required to get useful things done in
      graphics, phew.  [04:04:33]
<Dynetrekk_> rsynnott: "vocational computer programming" being some course
             where you learn just enough to program?  [04:04:36]
<hefner_> games are great programming exercises, so long as you write them
          from scratch. you get to use all kinds of fun stuff.  [04:04:55]
<rsynnott> Dynetrekk_: these things which teach people how to write business
           software of a certain type  [04:05:16]
<rsynnott> by filling in the blanks  [04:05:24]
<Dynetrekk_> rsynnott: I sees web "developers"  [04:05:37]
<Dynetrekk_> or sumptin  [04:05:40]
<rsynnott> or, ten years ago, those people who wrote frightening in-house VB
           apps  [04:05:58]
<rsynnott> the more things change, the more they stay the same :)  [04:06:07]
<hefner_> rsynnott: they probably were better off than modern web
          developers. at least VB *works*  [04:06:17]
<tic> Modern web developer equals PHP developer?  [04:06:56]
<Dynetrekk_> tic: or some fucker playing around with flashs my god.  [04:07:16]
<tsuru> or .NET  [04:07:18]
<rsynnott> well, anyone who takes a web framework thing and then makes the
           application work through trial and error, and liberal application
           of CTRL-V  [04:07:54]
<rsynnott> there are, funnily enough, good PHP programmers  [04:08:09]
<sykopomp> rsynnott: next-page? What?  [04:08:19]
<sykopomp> I mean, scroll-up*  [04:08:36]
<cYmen_> I would like to search for the last occurrence of something in a
         string using regex. Should I just search for it and use the last
         listitem or is there a more clever way?  [04:09:26]
<H4ns> cYmen_: you could try using a more clever regexp, maybe involving .*?
                                                                     [04:10:22]
<ManateeLazyCat>   [04:10:23]
<cYmen_> hmsso a .*? at the end to get the shortest string from the end?
                                                                     [04:11:11]
<cYmen_> sounds like a good idea :)  [04:11:16]
<dlowe> cYmen_: you could reverse the string and search for a reversed pattern
                                                                     [04:11:32]
<cYmen_> hrhr  [04:11:48]
<Dynetrekk_> this is hilarious. a colleague of mine (physicist) was so sick
             and tired of all the books trying to teach you to "make a
             database of your CDs", as this is not what he is interested
             in. this was yesterday. now, in pcl:  In this chapter you'll
             write a simple database for keeping track of CDs.  [04:12:16]
<dlowe> it's a tradition like "Hello, World"  [04:12:53]
<rsynnott> it's THE LAW  [04:13:05]
<dcrawford> I thought pcl did a database of mp3 data?  [04:13:25]
<rsynnott> (similarly, all web framework tutorials may implement either a blog
           or a reddit clone)  [04:13:27]
<H4ns> keeping track of cd's is pretty 1990s
<Dynetrekk_> hand we physicists don't like it  [04:13:29]
<sellout> CsDs?  [04:13:32]
<Dynetrekk_> dcrawford: who cares  [04:13:37]
<Dynetrekk_> I copy pasted, by the way  [04:13:42]
<tic> sellout, be-eer.  [04:13:47]
<rsynnott> (that's why there is no decent open-source blog software; everyone
           is far too sick of that example) :)  [04:14:02]
<lispm_> what is a 'cd'?  [04:14:04]
<Dynetrekk_> lispm_: think of it as a frisbee  [04:14:20]
<dcrawford> you know he has a link to the full source of the code on the book
            page iirc  [04:14:28]
<tic> lispm_, you put it under glasses.  [04:14:31]
<lispm_> ah, you mean the shiny thing with the clock  [04:16:14]
<drewc> rsynnott: maybe that's why us web developers keep building frameworks
        to build better blogs and then using that as the example h :P
                                                                     [04:16:55]
<stassats> minion: tell Dynetrekk_ about paip  [04:17:10]
<minion> Dynetrekk_: have a look at paip: Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence
         Programming: Case Studies in Common Lisp by Peter
         Norvig. http://www.cliki.net/paip
<lispm_> then you can blog about it  [04:17:18]
<tic> lispm_, :D  [04:17:22]
<hefner_> lispm knows no "cd", only *default-pathname-defaults*  [04:17:38]
<lispm_> ha!  [04:17:50]
<drewc> groan  [04:17:51]
<dcrawford> you mean cds haven't gone down the drain with the rest of the
            financial markets?  [04:18:14]
<tic> dcrawford, no, CD sales are blooming.  [04:18:30]
<dcrawford> tell that to tower music :P  [04:18:46]
<dcrawford> the one down the street from home is all closed up  [04:19:03]
<rsynnott> oddly, entertainment tends to survive major recessions surprisingly
           well  [04:19:05]
* rsynnott hopes that this trend continues this time 'round :S  [04:19:28]
* hefner_ doesn't  [04:19:35]
<dcrawford> hmm write a program that makes the longest chain of puns i and
            complete the loop  [04:20:01]
* rsynnott works in games industry so is biased  [04:20:06]
<rsynnott> dcrawford: fish. It'll have to be fish. You can work a fish name
           into almost any sentence  [04:20:30]
<rsynnott> (I'm pretty certain such programs are why prolog exists)  [04:20:57]
<Dynetrekk_> stassats: I have the "modern approach to AI" book on the table
             here :P  [04:21:01]
<Dynetrekk_> stassats: which seems to be the successori  [04:21:18]
<drewc> Dynetrekk_: don't make the mistake of thinking PAIP is a book about
        AI.  [04:21:25]
<p_l> dcrawford: making puns is hard. Especially in Java ;-) (sorry for inside
      joke)  [04:21:38]
<drewc> -+  [04:21:41]
<Dynetrekk_> drewc: ah. but I can't get it on the webs? doesn't seem
             downloadable  [04:21:49]
<drewc> Dynetrekk_: no, it's the old fashioned kind of paper book.  [04:22:18]
* drewc hugs his copy of paip.  [04:22:30]
* p_l couldn't help making fun of 'making puns' programs  [04:22:45]
<Dynetrekk_> drewc: I have a lot of those, but not the one mentioned
                                                                     [04:23:01]
<Dynetrekk_> drewc: due to my love for trees, I'll stick to pcl for now
                                                                     [04:23:14]
<p_l> Dynetrekk_: Use a library  [04:23:30]
<Dynetrekk_> p_l: I'll see what I can dig up  [04:23:54]
<drewc> Dynetrekk_: well, i have a paper copy of PCL as well s i have a love
        for the planet and it has a smaller carbon footprint than my
        laptop. :)  [04:24:10]
<drewc> Dynetrekk_: but PAIP and PCL are different books really.  [04:24:36]
<Dynetrekk_> drewc: I need the laptop anyway  [04:24:38]
<drewc> opposites actually.  [04:24:43]
<Dynetrekk_> drewc: I don't doubt its I just don't want to buy all the books
             people recommend at the same time :P I don't have time to read
             them all anyway  [04:25:05]
<drewc> fair enough :)  [04:25:11]
<rsynnott> drewc: depends very much where you live, then :)
<tic> PAIP is good for the exercises involving lists.  [04:25:37]
<drewc> rsynnott: we have  lot of trees here.  [04:25:45]
<tic> whereas PCL is good for showing you that you can do practical things
      with Lisp.  [04:25:49]
<rsynnott> (if you live beside a nuclear power plant, your laptop is clean and
           space age, but if you live near a coal power plant, your laptop is
           evil, planet destroying, and probably covered with a fine layer of
           soot) :)  [04:26:13]
<Dynetrekk_> it's actually really hard to know what is environmentally
             friendly  [04:26:47]
<Dynetrekk_> the only thing I'm sure of is that cars are not  [04:26:55]
<drewc> rsynnott: actually, i live on a boat an generate a not insignificant
        amount of my own power :)  [04:27:03]
<Dynetrekk_> drewc: how?  [04:27:18]
<dcrawford> from all the hot air coming our your ears?  [04:27:28]
<drewc> Dynetrekk_: solar/generator and sadly still shore power :(  [04:28:11]
<rsynnott> and if you live near a wind power plant, of course, your laptop is
           clean but only works half the time, and tends to shred seagulls :)
                                                                     [04:28:29]
<adeht> PAIP is an exposition of eye-candy Lisp code.  [04:28:36]
<hefner_> rsynnott: sounds like linux  [04:29:01]
* rsynnott quite likes the idea of transferring the sins of the generator to
  the actual appliance  [04:29:45]
<rsynnott> 'every time you recompile that project, a bird explodes in a cloud
           of feathers' etc  [04:30:11]
<tic> drewc, how about a water generator thingy?  [04:30:15]
<drewc> tic: not yet, nor have i a wind vane, but such things are coming on
        the big boat when it's done.  [04:30:43]
<tic> drewc, so you're on the small boat now, then?  [04:30:57]
<drewc> tic: yeah i my little plastic cave :)  [04:31:13]
<drewc> rsynnott: i have to recompile a project nowi poor birds....  [04:36:02]
<Dynetrekk_> drewc: solar power? are you giving back to the grid when not
             using it?  [04:36:11]
<drewc> Dynetrekk_: no, we don't generate enough really. It's a boat after
        all, not a lot of surface area for panels.  [04:36:53]
<Dynetrekk_> drewc: but you use it all then?  [04:37:11]
<rsynnott> 'every time you build sbcl, an innocent politician has to make a
           tortured pause due to a question about nuclear power' etc
                                                                     [04:37:18]
<drewc> though this is changing i eventually we'll have fabric-type cells
        everywhere  [04:37:30]
<rsynnott> do those exist at sensible prices, at the moment?  [04:37:45]
<hefner_> drewc: a solari sail?  [04:37:53]
<Dynetrekk_> the energy cost of producing a solar panel is not insignificant,
             so it's not exactly given that buying one is environmentally
             friendly  [04:38:09]
<drewc> rsynnott: prices are coming down to reasonable levels.  [04:38:57]
<rsynnott> same problem applies to wind, particularly for home generation
           things  [04:39:04]
<drewc> Dynetrekk_: you would not believe how expensice it is to get mains
        power in the middle of the ocean!  [04:39:14]
*** cYmen_ (n=cymen@squint.a-oben.org) is now known as cYmen  [04:39:15]
<Dynetrekk_> rsynnott: same problem applies to industrial wind  [04:39:16]
<drewc> expensive  [04:39:21]
<Dynetrekk_> drewc: I don't know, near an oil platform it could be OK
                                                                     [04:39:28]
<lisppaste> _theHAM pasted "advice wanted: calc program" at
            http://paste.lisp.org/display/71536  [04:41:19]
<rsynnott> drewc: you could always install a rowing machine with a dynamo :)
                                                                     [04:42:19]
<rsynnott> location-appropriate!  [04:42:24]
<drewc> rsynnott: actually, we've considered a bicycle hooked up to the
        flywheeli both to turn the prop and generate juice.  [04:43:22]
<hefner_> yeah, put the wife and kids to work  [04:43:38]
* rsynnott just gets electricity from the grid  [04:43:49]
<rsynnott> the generation company helpfully details the fuel mix for the month
           for my region on the back, to let me know just how guilty I should
           feel THIS week :)  [04:44:24]
<lispm_> just have written a Pascal hello world program with Zmacs  [04:48:23]
<_theHAM> no-one feels like checking out http://paste.lisp.org/display/71536
          and fixing my bad habits while they still can? :p  [04:48:34]
<lispm_> looks like Zmacs has a fancy template feature  [04:48:42]
<lispm_> is anybody using something like yasnippet with Emacs and CL?
                                                                     [04:49:02]
<rsynnott> but does your compiler target some symbolics machine?  [04:51:53]
<rsynnott> :)  [04:51:55]
<lispm_> it does  [04:52:27]
<lispm_> m-x compile and execute pascal program  [04:52:56]
<hefner_> I did not know there was a lispm pascal compiler  [04:53:22]
<lispm_> quite fancy, with syntax sensitive Zmacs  [04:53:48]
<fusss> good afternoon  [04:54:29]
<lispm_> when I type   for <end> in Zmacs, it inserts a template for a for
         loop, c-sh-n walks over the template elements  [04:56:24]
<lispm_> redshank also has some template stuff for Emacs, I need to ask
         michaelw about it  [04:57:29]

<beach> sykopomp: You might want to revive the OpenGL backend for McCLIM.  [13:41:34]
<sykopomp> beach: I may, once I'm more familiar with cl-opengl (or opengl in general). Is the backend available somewhere on the webternets?
                                                                                                                                          [13:43:05]
<beach> I think it's in the CVS repository.  [13:43:29]
<sykopomp> for mcclim?  [13:43:54]
<beach> yeah  [13:44:04]
<sykopomp> great :)  [13:44:17]
<beach> Backends/OpenGL  [13:44:35]
<sykopomp> I'm kind of being beaten upside the head with java right now, but I'll look into it. That's definitely a must-have.  [13:44:36]
<slyrus_> beach: this shows my general naivitee regarding clim backends, but I'm not sure I need a whole opengl backend, I just want an opengl
          window in an otherwise clx backend-ed process. is that doable?  [13:45:48]
<_3b> slyrus_: i'd want clim inside the gl window :)  [13:46:19]
<beach> slyrus_: I would think it is.  And I think it has been done.  [13:46:24]
<_3b> windows created with clx supposedly work with cl-opengl  [13:47:00]
<sykopomp> it really would be nice to build an actual lisp community :(  [13:48:14]
<sykopomp> not enough hackers == not enough finished neat things  [13:48:26]
<hefner> but too many hackers == not enough low hanging fruit :)  [13:54:51]
<dto> sykopomp: /me is part of the lisp community!!  [13:55:35]
<sykopomp> there's too much low hanging fruit right now that needs too much time to implement  [13:55:36]
* dto beams  [13:55:40]
<lukego> you guys should join me in OS hacking and we create a new community of total weirdos who can't interact with normal humans :)  [13:55:50]
<sykopomp> there's just so much that could really use a little bit of help to get cleaned up a bit, or maintained a bit  [13:56:00]
<gigamonkey> lukego: uh, I think we have that already, thanks.  [13:56:05]
<lukego> giga: bah, take what we have and square it! ;-)  [13:56:29]
<dto> sykopomp: is it you who subscribed to watch one of my github things  [13:56:38]
<sykopomp> dto: are you the CLON guy?  [13:56:50]
<sykopomp> if so, yes  [13:56:55]
<dto> the clon guy :) yes  [13:57:05]
<dto> your subscription puts interest in CLON at an all-time high.  [13:57:23]
<sykopomp> dto: I was thinking of doing something similar, but possibly basing it on CLOS instead  [13:57:24]
<sykopomp> hahaha  [13:57:29]
<sykopomp> I may end up just fussing around with CLON. Is there a reason why you didn't just MOP stuff up?  [13:57:45]
<dto> well, several reasons  [13:58:27]
<sykopomp> I'd like to know them :D  [13:58:37]
<dto> not the least of which, is that it is ported from Emacs Lisp, where there was no MOP to work with.  [13:58:46]
<lukego> dto: interesting. I have recently pushed Io onto very-interesting-things list  [13:58:47]
<dto> lukego: i might have, but CL has been on the top of my stack for a long time  [13:59:44]

<dto> yeah i can't claim to have researched it thoroughly  [14:02:00]
<dto> but i'm quite happy with clon and its application in my game engine  [14:02:14]
*** #lisp modes: +nc  [14:02:27]

<dto> it definitely serves its purpose, and also has a neat message-queueing thing  [14:02:28]
<sykopomp> I don't believe you can have CLOS not be class-oriented, but what I'm hoping to try is to have a system backed by unique classes (probably
           gensymed), and the classes would (should) be as flexible as a regular prototype system.  [14:02:36]
<dto> hmm.  [14:03:43]
<sykopomp> I mean, what I want for the object system is to make a really dynamic object system available user-side, sort of what you'd get with MOOs (and
           it should be able to host MOOs, for that matter)  [14:03:48]
<sykopomp> but I have no idea how to make method-editing available  [14:03:59]
<dto> hmm. i should have resewarched moos  [14:04:07]
<sykopomp> MOOs are like MUDs, except they tend to be heavily building-oriented.  [14:04:23]
<sykopomp> so players make their own rooms, script their own items, etc.  [14:04:31]
<sykopomp> a big issue is that I want to avoid the awful mess that is keeping everything in files, and have everything living in dynamic-land + an
           elephant database  [14:05:26]
<beach> sykopomp: It sounds like you need a system that implements universal persitence.  [14:09:47]
<sykopomp> beach: universal?  [14:10:05]
<sykopomp> vs. just game-objects?  [14:10:12]
<beach> No files.  [14:10:13]
<beach> No distinction between main memory and disk.  [14:10:35]
<sykopomp> exactly, no. Right now, I have a class-based system which uses bknr's datastore for persistence.  [14:10:36]
<sykopomp> I was starting the process of porting stuff over to elephant (turns out I can't fit everything into memorys go figure), when I started playing
           around with something built with LPC and realized I could really use a prototype-like system for objects.  [14:11:30]

<_3b> S11001001: without the declare, you get an warning because NIL isn't a valid package designator, which sbcl knows is required for find-package
                                                                                                                                                [11:53:28]
<S11001001> _3b: I don't get the warning without the declare on 64  [11:53:58]
<george__> have anybody tried to assimilate haskell feactures with lisp macros ?  [11:54:01]
<hefner> beach: it's fascinating in that it's only ~400 lines of code, and the sort of thing that would be impossible if every bad claim I make about
         CLIM were really true  [11:54:16]
<_3b> S11001001: not getting it on some platforms sounds odd, don't know what causes that  [11:54:38]
<stassats> S11001001: and i get  [11:54:42]
<beach> hefner: yeah, it's quite impressive in that respect.  [11:55:07]
<stassats> S11001001: what's your debug settings?  [11:55:08]
<S11001001> ah, I see, I get it on 64 with standard settings  [11:55:58]
<S11001001> for curious I run on (declaim (optimize (speed 0) (compilation-speed 0) (space 2) (safety 2) (debug 2)))  [11:56:24]
<hefner> beach: if I wrote this, interaction with the main canvas would've been entirely event-driven  [11:56:26]
<hefner> I wonder what that would look like.  [11:56:46]
<beach> hefner: you shall have to write it to find out.  [11:57:10]
<S11001001> regardless I don't see why this should be a compile-breaking warning, because it's not that SBCL can tell the code will *always* have bad
            types, just that it might sometimes  [11:57:18]
<S11001001> which is the case for a great deal of Lisp code in general  [11:57:30]
<_3b> sure it isn't ASDF doing the compilation breaking?  [11:58:31]
<S11001001> ASDF assumes the compile failed if compile-file returns NIL, which SBCL does after certain warnings  [11:59:38]
<_3b> you could replace the declare with (check-type owner-name string) if it isn't convenient to avoid the nil  [12:03:06]
<S11001001> that is a nice workaround, dropped in and #+sbcled, thanks _3b  [12:05:02]
<_3b> or i guess (when owner-name (find-symbol s)) if you'd rather return nil instead of erroring  [12:07:11]
<S11001001> I could, but logically, owner-name will never be nil  [12:10:41]
<S11001001> the aref is actually looking in a list of register binding locations, in code that is only executed when the regex matches, and the group is
            not optional  [12:11:39]
<S11001001> specifically, cl-ppcre:register-groups-bind (owner-name) (#?/^(.+)-ID$/ (symbol-name slot-name))  [12:11:48]
<stassats> S11001001: then why there is IF, if it never will be nil?  [12:15:09]
<_3b> stassats: generic macro that doesn't know that  [12:15:30]
* hefner wishes defstruct would/could make the boa constructor automatically (without having to type the arglist)  [13:00:46]
<hefner> should I feel ashamed for my occasional naming the variable in a defmethod specializer as "this" to make it read cute and avoid typing the same
         name twice?  [13:23:44]
<S11001001> yes, because the pure soul calls it "self" instead  [13:24:09]
<hefner> yeah, but that's stupid.  [13:25:09]
<hefner> it isn't even proper english.  [13:25:15]
* _3b wonders if one would name the 2nd var THAT when doing multiple dispatch  [13:25:27]
<hefner> apparently I've done that twice.  [13:28:47]
<_3b> google code search says SELF is more common than THIS  [13:33:14]
<_3b> THIS seems pretty common in elisp though  [13:33:22]
<slyrus_> H4ns1: well, my hunchentoot instance finally give up the ghost, but after much longer than before with a different failure mode.  [13:58:47]
<slyrus_> "Argh! corrupted error depth, halting"  [14:00:53]
<slyrus_> that could just as easily be an SBCL bug, as opposed to, say, hunchentoot doing something silly.  [14:01:10]

<nikodemus> generally speaking inlining should be restricted to placed where it allows the compiler to do a better job, or where the body of the function
            ends up containing no full calls  [21:42:30]
<nikodemus> (or where there a measurable benefits, of course)  [21:42:50]
<nikodemus> not that sbcl code base as a whole follows thats  [21:43:10]
<tcr> I'd make get-cat-entry inline again.  [21:44:01]
<tcr> in my readtable-iterator it's used in a (< char base-char-code-limit) branch  [21:44:58]
<tcr> but I'll add the inline declaims myself in that patch. (It's not ready anyway)  [21:45:31]
<tcr> next patches in my queue are (once the current set got applied), splitting up some reader-errors into more specific conditions (I need that for an
      application), and then moving the reader in its own sb-reader package.  [21:48:09]
<nikodemus> i'm still not sold on the sb-reader package. i think part of it belong in sb-int, and parts in sb-ext (but i don't claim to have thought
            about it properly)  [21:51:22]
<nikodemus> and iirc some of the other committers liked it  [21:51:40]
<attila_lendvai> tcr: fwiw, i wouldn't abbreviate CHAR-ATTR-TABLE  [23:04:18]

* tic hands lispm_ a bunch of wovels.  [23:15:43]
<rsynnott> lispm_: careful, or you'll turn into paul graham  [23:16:33]
<lispm_> oh oh!  [23:16:55]
<demmeln> tcr: Hi. Aren't you the slime developer from the munich lisp meeting on Wednesday?  [23:20:18]
<lispm_> he probably is, how was it?  [23:20:53]
<waldofll> tic: are you there?  [23:31:37]
<tic> waldofll, yeah.  [23:34:00]
<waldofll> tic: I was reading the logs and noticed that a few days ago you were chatting with luis (he was working on some HL7 messages project). You
           mentioned you had done some work on that in the past to parse HL7 messages  [23:43:18]
<tic> waldofll, oh, not really.  you got the wrong impression, I'm afraid. I was merely doing HL7 message verification by hand at Siemens Medical
      Solutions.  [23:43:54]
*** Grilinctus (n=Aankhen@122.162.167.223) is now known as Aankhen``  [23:44:19]
<waldofll> tic: Ah. I see. I guess I did get the wrong impression :)  [23:44:21]
<tic> waldofll, sorry.  [23:44:26]
<schme> evenin'  [23:44:42]
<rsynnott> by hand? eek  [23:44:43]
<waldofll> tic: I'm new to Lisp and am trying to develop an ANSI X12 message parser  [23:44:52]
<tic> waldofll, have a look at the RFC-something-or-the-other parser screencast at lispm.dyndns.org  [23:45:10]
<waldofll> tic: thanks, will do  [23:45:36]
<tic> rsynnott, hey, who needs unit testing, right?  [23:45:44]
<rsynnott> looking at the source of a corba implementation might also be useful?  [23:46:18]
<madnificent> it is the worst code ever, but still.  I'm happy with having shadows and shading :) In a strange form of misplaced proudness: I can has

* tic hopes it's a cat  [00:00:01]
<tic> maybe if I squint just so.  [00:00:27]
<madnificent> tic: built out of primitives?!  [00:00:37]
<tic> madnificent, sure.  [00:00:44]
<tic> two spheres and a set of circular planes.  [00:01:01]
<tic> or just a bunch of balls, depending on how anatomically correct you want to be. :)  [00:01:21]
<schme> Looks like a cat to me.  [00:01:24]
<madnificent> tic: I'll write a lisp-format to define stuff later, now I had to parse xml, which doesn't make that easys but with a minor effort,
              defining scenes with lisp would be 10e10 times more efficient  [00:01:33]
<schme> a bit abstract maybe, but you can tell it is a cat.  [00:01:36]
<tic> madnificent, have you measured? (the 10e10 number)  [00:01:48]
<tic> I think you have a rounding error there.  [00:01:57]
<madnificent> tic: aaah damn! I haven't enabled the alien technology for that 10e10 -_-  [00:02:46]
