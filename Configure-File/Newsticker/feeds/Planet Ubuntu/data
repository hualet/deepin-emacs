There is already some prior knowledge with the sales personnel that large organisations do not need the pre-installed Windows software.</p>\n<p>Dell used to sell the N Series laptops with Ubuntu Linux, however they do not sell them anymore, at least in Europe. I contacted a Dell customer care manager on this issue and I was told that N Series laptops are available when you call Dell Sales by phone. I did just that, however the telephone salesperson explained that they do not have N Series laptops anymore. He verified with his own manager.</p>\n<p>Dell does sell netbooks with Ubuntu Linux in Europe. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.dell.co.uk/mini\" target=\"_blank\">Dell Mini</a> or the <a href=\"http://www.dell.com/content/topics/reftopic.aspx/pub/products/latit_kat?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=k12&amp;~section=latitude-2100\" target=\"_blank\">Dell Latitude 2100</a>. The situation with the netbooks is almost perfect, but&#8230;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1023\" title=\"Dell UK Latitude 2100, Choose early between XP or Ubuntu\" src=\"http://simos.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/DellUK-Latitude-ChooseXPUbuntu.png\" alt=\"Dell UK Latitude 2100, Choose early between XP or Ubuntu\" /></p>\n<p>What would be desirable is to provide the option, when you customize the Latitude 2100, to be able to select the operating system under the Operating System options. In this way, the customer is in a position to make a better decision between the differences of the two options.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1024\" title=\"Dell Greece, select the operating system while customizing the computer\" src=\"http://simos.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Dell-Greece-XP-Ubuntu-cropped.png\" alt=\"Dell Greece, select the operating system while customizing the computer\" /></p>\n<p>In a regional Dell website, it is possible to select the operating system while you are customizing the computer. In this case, when you select Ubuntu Linux, you can easily see that you are saving €30 compared to the initial price.</p>\n<p><span>It is not clear why Dell UK and Dell Germany do not provide the facility that we see with Dell Greece. Normally the localised editions of a website take any changes later than the main languages (English, German).</span></p>\n<p><strong>Updated (soon after posted): </strong>It is possible to get the Dell UK page for the Latitude 2100 so that both pre-installed Windows and Ubuntu appear in the same section. It might be an update that has been rolled out just recently. When you visit the Customise page,  you can now see that by selecting pre-installed Ubuntu Linux, you save £24 compared to pre-installed XP.</p>\n<p>What would be ideal is for the consumer to have the option to avoid the pre-installed Windows, in a way shown above at the Dell Greece website for the Latitude 2100. Having options for Ubuntu Linux or FreeDOS (for those who already have a Windows license) would be the best value for the customers. This would make Dell the best company around.</p>\n<p>So, what&#8217;s going on with the other laptop manufacturers?</p>\n<p>Acer, Asus, Compaq and HP do not appear to sell computers without pre-installed Windows to the European market. I have not been able to locate retailers that would sell a laptop with FreeDOS, let alone a Linux distribution.</p>\n<p>Is this the case with Acer, Asus, Compaq and HP in other markets?</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1025\" title=\"Acer Laptop with FreeDOS (SE Asian market)\" src=\"http://simos.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Acer-Laptop-with-FreeDOS.png\" alt=\"Acer Laptop with FreeDOS (SE Asian market)\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1028\" title=\"Asus Laptop with FreeDOS (SE Asian market)\" src=\"http://simos.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Asus-Laptop-with-FreeDOS1.png\" alt=\"Asus Laptop with FreeDOS (SE Asian market)\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1027\" title=\"Compaq Laptop with FreeDOS (SE Asian market)\" src=\"http://simos.info/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Compaq-Laptop-with-FreeDOS.png\" alt=\"Compaq Laptop with FreeDOS (SE Asian market)\" /></p>\n<p>This is an example of laptop models from the SE Asian market. The laptops come with FreeDOS and if you want pre-installed Windows, you pay extra (€53 or $74). The quoted price for the laptop is not subjected to local tax for the specific SE Asian country. Here is the price equivalent for each laptop,</p>\n<p>Acer: €325 or $460</p>\n<p>Asus: €525 or $745</p>\n<p>Compaq: €365 or $515</p>\n<p>Manufacturers such as Lenovo and Toshiba appear as black sheep to me, regarding the European market. Lenovo is supposed to sell laptops with SuSE Linux, however I could not find an example. Toshiba is completely out of the radar. They might not be a big laptop manufacturer.</p>\n<p>What would be great for the European customer is to have the option to buy a product without pre-installed Windows. And this option of buying a computer without pre-installed Windows should be a visible and accessible option.</p>\n<p><small><a href=\"http://simos.info/blog/archives/1021#comments\">No comment</a></small></p>	") (pubDate nil "Sun, 09 Aug 2009 14:07:57 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Simos Xenitellis")) (item nil (title nil "Yuriy Kozlov: Impressions of C#") (guid nil "http://gamemank.wordpress.com/?p=71") (link nil "http://gamemank.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/impressions-of-csharp/") (description nil "\n	<img class=\"face\" src=\"http://planet.ubuntu.com/heads/yuriy-kozlov.png\" alt=\"\">\n<div class=\"snap_preview\"><br /><p>Disclaimer: this post is about my recent experience working with C# and has nothing to do with the Mono debate.</p>\n<p>Over the last month and a half I&#8217;ve been working on an application using C#, .NET, and Windows.Forms in Visual Studio 2008.  I started by learning C# (unfortunately from some outdated materials).  At first it seemed like they took the worst instead of the best things from Java and C++, but overall I&#8217;ve gotten to like the language.  Here are some of my thoughts on it, some more elaborated than others.</p>\n<p>I like <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x9fsa0sw(VS.80).aspx\" target=\"_blank\">properties</a>[1].  They get rid of a lot of clutter and allow you to do some neat things.  They also tend to much reduce people&#8217;s tendencies to use public fields.  I really like VS&#8217;s &#8220;encapsulate field&#8221; option that generates a property from a field for you.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand the need for the <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7c5ka91b(VS.80).aspx\" target=\"_blank\">internal</a> keyword or why this is the default visibility.</p>\n<p>I like how there are interfaces as in Java.  I&#8217;m not sure if I like how there is no multiple inheritance as in C++ and Python.  I&#8217;m not sure if I like how implementing an interface and extending a class uses the same syntax.</p>\n<p>Generics are nice, but C# has the same historical wart as Java where the set of Collections in the system library includes old non-generic classes that are still used.</p>\n<p>I miss C++&#8217;s consts everywhere.  No const parameters or const methods or const return types in C#.</p>\n<p>I like how you can write <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288474(VS.71).aspx\" target=\"_blank\">unsafe code</a>.  I haven&#8217;t actually made use of it yet, but I think this is a huge advantage over Java.</p>\n<p>The Reflection API can be useful, but it&#8217;s not nearly as easy as Python&#8217;s getattr() &amp; co.</p>\n<p>String comparison with == by value is a great improvement from Java.</p>\n<p>C# has operator overloading.  Yay.</p>\n<p><strong>Events</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest thing C# has over Java for me is <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/awbftdfh.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">events</a>.</p>\n<p>Events suck in Java.  Most of the time you end up having to define a whole extra class to handle one.  Since handling an event is so tedious, they are often quite generic and you have to check the arguments for what actually happened.  The one good thing about it is it&#8217;s clear OOP with no magic.</p>\n<p>Handling events in pure C/C++ usually involves callbacks with function pointer voodoo.  Qt provides a very nice type safe layer with signals and slots, with an almost ideal syntax, but the implementation is questionable and magical.</p>\n<p>C# has events built into the language.  A class can have events with specific arguments and can invoke them much like Qt signals.  Events have types that identify their signatures, so it&#8217;s type safe and no magic.  However, that&#8217;s also where it gets clunky.  For every event with different arguments you need to also declare a <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173171(VS.80).aspx\" target=\"_blank\">delegate</a> for the type (from what I understand but haven&#8217;t read into yet, C# 3.0 provides some generics to make this less tedious).  When connecting an event, you need to create an instance of the delegate.</p>\n<p>In addition, .NET requires that all events take two arguments: a sender object (nice!) and an EventArgs object with the rest of the data (yuck!), which makes the whole thing almost as bad as Java.  But without that restriction, which is only for compliance with other .NET languages, it&#8217;s almost as nice as Qt signals.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as with many parts of C#, there are some restrictions on how events can be used that make the language seem incomplete and/or don&#8217;t quite jive with what seems like sensible OOP.  Only a class that declares an event can call it, not a subclass.  Events are null if there is nothing connected to them, and you have to check for this.  The race condition implied there is quite disturbing, but I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve run into a problem yet.  In most cases, to workaround both problems, you have to declare a separate method that does this check and invokes the event, which makes the whole thing again more tedious and clunky than it should be.</p>\n<p>Events seem to be objects.  They have a type and operators.  But you can&#8217;t just use them as objects, can&#8217;t pass them around.  An event is basically a delegate with stripped down functionality and this stripping down is built into the language, which seems rather wonky.  Of course, the only reason I would want to do any of these things is to work around problems in Windows.Forms.  Also maybe because I&#8217;m spoiled by python where everything is on equal standing as an object.</p>\n<p><strong>Limitations and Warts<br />\n</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to the problems with events, there are some other limitations I&#8217;ve run into.</p>\n<p>virtual keyword: This is one of the aforementioned carryovers from C++ that is not in Java that I don&#8217;t undersand why it was brought back in C#[2].  There is probably a good technical reason for it, but API-wise it&#8217;s just annoying.</p>\n<p>Name hiding: C# allows you to create members in subclasses that hide (no polymorphism) rather than override base class members.  The language has the &#8220;<a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/51y09td4(VS.71).aspx\" target=\"_blank\">new</a>&#8221; keyword to do this, but does not require its use.  I think most of the time hiding methods like this without polymorphism is just asking for trouble, and the keyword seems almost useless if it is not required.  The compiler does give a warning when you hide something without using new, so I told VS to report those warnings as errors.</p>\n<p>You can have type constraints on generic arguments, but for some reason this type cannot be an enum.  It also can&#8217;t be object, which, while redundant, seems like a rather arbitrary limitation for a language to make.</p>\n<p>I expected C# enums to be fancy like Java&#8217;s, but it seems despite being derived from a class, they&#8217;re mostly limited to C++ enums.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb383977.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Extension methods</a> are neat, but why aren&#8217;t there extension properties?</p>\n<p>I have yet to explore lambdas (C# 3.0), but delegates as anonymous methods seem a bit clunky sometimes.</p>\n<p>Unsafe code in C# seems like it could cause a whole new set of problems other than those in C++, since everything is allocated on the heap and objects are managed.  There are various keywords to deal with pointers to data residing in objects managed by the VM, but it seems like the combination is just asking for trouble.</p>\n<p>Overall, while it has its sometimes strange limitations, I rather like C# and it sure beats Java.  When/if I get to writing unsafe code, I&#8217;ll see how it really compares to C++.  .NET, Windows.Forms, and Visual Studio are another story, but this  is getting long enough so I&#8217;ll leave them for another post.</p>\n<p>[1] I wish the MSDN site would work in Konqueror, but I&#8217;m not terribly surprised.</p>\n<p>[2] Supposedly C# was based on C++ and not Java, but I find this hard to believe.</p>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/gamemank.wordpress.com/71/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/gamemank.wordpress.com/71/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/gamemank.wordpress.com/71/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/gamemank.wordpress.com/71/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/gamemank.wordpress.com/71/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/gamemank.wordpress.com/71/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/gamemank.wordpress.com/71/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/gamemank.wordpress.com/71/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/gamemank.wordpress.com/71/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/gamemank.wordpress.com/71/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=gamemank.wordpress.com&amp;blog=835346&amp;post=71&amp;subd=gamemank&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" /></div>	") (pubDate nil "Sun, 09 Aug 2009 12:30:41 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Yuriy")) (item nil (title nil "Venkat Raghavan: Amazon: Windows XP Refund") (guid nil "http://www.robotgeek.org/blog/?p=229") (link nil "http://www.robotgeek.org/blog/2009/08/08/amazon-windows-xp-refund/") (description nil "\n	<img class=\"face\" src=\"http://planet.ubuntu.com/heads/robotgeek.png\" alt=\"\">\n<p>I&#8217;ve been a linux user for quite a while now.

I came across an <a href=\"http://infotrope.net/blog/2009/08/05/action-and-reaction-on-avoiding-offense/\">article</a> on <a href=\"http://infotrope.net/blog/\">Kirrily Robert&#8217;s blog</a> on the use of the word &#8220;offense&#8221; in the context of sexism.  The RSS content indicated that there were several comments on this post, and so I clicked through to check it out.  The result was this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://mdzlog.files.wordpress.com/2009/08/screenshot-sonicwall-web-site-blocked-shiretoko.png?w=700&#038;h=393\" alt=\"Screenshot-SonicWALL - Web Site Blocked - Shiretoko\" title=\"Screenshot-SonicWALL - Web Site Blocked - Shiretoko\" width=\"700\" height=\"393\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-599\" /></p>\n<p>My phone was connected to the hotel&#8217;s WiFi, which apparently has a SonicWALL content filter installed.  This filter seems to think that Kirrily&#8217;s blog is <strong>&#8220;Adult/Mature Content&#8221;</strong>.  I&#8217;m not sure why this is.  Perhaps because the word &#8220;sexism&#8221; has &#8220;sex&#8221; in it?</p>\n<p>SonicWALL has a web site where one can <a href=\"http://cfssupport.sonicwall.com/Support/web/eng/newui/viewRating.jsp\">view their ratings</a> for arbitrary web sites, and it confirms that <a href=\"http://infotrope.net\">infotrope.net</a> (apparently the whole site) is classified as <strong>Category 6: Adult/Mature Content</strong> and <strong>Category 41: Society and Lifestyle</strong>.  There is no explanation of what these categories mean, or how the classification process works.</p>\n<p>They provide a form to request that they <a href=\"http://cfssupport.sonicwall.com/Support/web/eng/newui/ratingReview.jsp\">reevaluate their rating</a> of a particular site, so I did that.  Without knowing why they classified this site the way they did, I don&#8217;t see how a reevaluation will help, though.  They asked me to suggest better categories for it, but none of them made sense.  They can&#8217;t be serious about using a list of a few dozen static categories for all of the content on the web.  Can they?</p>\n<p>I wrote them a short note explaining that I did not think the site merited an &#8220;Adult/Mature&#8221; content rating, a euphemism usually reserved for pornography.  I have very little hope that this action will ever elicit a response, and it certainly won&#8217;t restore my access to the site this weekend while I&#8217;m here.  I am not a customer of SonicWALL, and don&#8217;t expect ever to be.</p>\n<p>I will mention to the hotel that their system caused this problem for me, but I don&#8217;t expect them to act on this complaint either.  Companies which install content filtering systems don&#8217;t plan to spend time maintaining them to make sure that they provide a good quality of service, and this is sure to seem like an unnecessary hassle to them.</p>\n<p>This is why I hate content filtering systems.  They disenfranchise end users by making content decisions on their behalf, and make it their responsibility to work through the bureaucracy when it goes wrong.</p>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/mdzlog.wordpress.com/598/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/mdzlog.wordpress.com/598/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/mdzlog.wordpress.com/598/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/mdzlog.wordpress.com/598/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/mdzlog.wordpress.com/598/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/mdzlog.wordpress.com/598/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/mdzlog.wordpress.com/598/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/mdzlog.wordpress.com/598/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/mdzlog.wordpress.com/598/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/mdzlog.wordpress.com/598/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=mdzlog.alcor.net&amp;blog=4533171&amp;post=598&amp;subd=mdzlog&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" /></div>	") (pubDate nil "Sat, 08 Aug 2009 21:23:28 +0000") (dc:creator nil "mdz")) (item nil (title nil "Cyril Lavier: SFS Update") (guid nil "urn:md5:7bf3c9baf221cf638a0c6793c6bb5e64") (link nil "http://www.davromaniak.eu/index.php?post/2009/08/08/SFS-Update2") (description nil "\n	<img class=\"face\" src=\"http://planet.ubuntu.com/heads/davromaniak.png\" alt=\"\">\n<p>A tool for phpbb forum administrators</p>    <p>Hi</p>\n\n\n<p>10 months ago, I started hosting a friend's phpbb forum.

When you&#8217;re really little you want everything for yourself, but quickly you learn that playing is more fun when you share what you&#8217;ve got.

Tangerine allows you to share your media with people nearby over the DAAP protocol.

Your media- shared.</p>\n<p>Tangerine isn&#8217;t new; Tangerine has been around for a little bit but unfortunately its development has stagnated. I love sharing, and I wanted to be able to share media from Banshee, so I talked to Snorp, and picked up development. Tangerine 0.3.1&#8217;s only major &#8220;feature&#8221; is a ramped up Banshee plugin that will share your Banshee media collection, but if you ask me, the face that I&#8217;ve moved development to Launchpad hosted bzr (lp:tangerine), bug tracker, and projectmanagement is a feature in and of itself. You can find all of the fun new project stuff at <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/tangerine\">https://launchpad.net/tangerine</a>.</p>\n<p>But now the exciting part! We&#8217;ve got a new release!! Tangerine 0.3.1!! <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/tangerine/0.3/0.3.1\">https://launchpad.net/tangerine/0.3/0.3.1</a>. The release tarball is linked from there, as is the md5sum. I haven&#8217;t built packages yet, but they will be available from the <a href=\"https://launchpad.net/~tangerine-developers/+archive/ppa\">tangerine-developers ppa</a> in a couple of days.</p>\n<p>0.3.1 isn&#8217;t a big release, but we&#8217;ve got big plans. If you&#8217;re interested take a look at the planned releases, and help us hack up those features, plus that one you think would make Tangerine a killer.

Over the past few months I have been rather quiet around here due to various reasons. Plain and simple, I was shit on months back and I haven&#8217;t overcome the hurt I received from this. I was pushed away and because of this I took quite a bit of time off to collect my thoughts and see where I wanted my future to go.</p>\n<p>Many of you know that I have decided to spend more time on cycling than anything Ubuntu and I think this was for the best, and still think it is. Jono has been talking about burnout recently, however my reason for my so called burnout episode isn&#8217;t covered by his talk (yet?). Over the past few months I kept trying to fit in again and found it difficult on many levels. Since 2005 I have been working pretty much non-stop in the Kubuntu community and this has been my best experience ever. I have made a ton of new friends that I hope to keep forever. Everyone there is just truly amazing.</p>\n<p>So where was I? Well, when I started in Kubuntu I was that documentation dude to help out my buddy Jonathan Jesse. I did this for a few months before I wanted more. I had done Debian development for many years prior helping out where I could, so I decided to go ahead and work on some packaging for Kubuntu. After 2 years of pestering enough people I finally did the whole MOTU and Core Developer thing. From there I served on various councils such as the Kubuntu Councils, MOTU Council, Regional Membership Board, and I am sure some others. I have written various pieces of code, fixed bugs upstream, and run the whole gambit of what I thought a good community member would do for a project he loved and cherished deeply.</p>\n<p>In my time off, I missed so much. There have been so many changes that I haven&#8217;t been able to keep up with, and believe me, this is a good thing. Ubuntu and Kubuntu are maturing faster and better than I could have ever imagined. Because of this, and my time away riding the hell out of my bike, I don&#8217;t know where I fit in anymore. I am working with Scott and others on the Kubuntu Netbook edition and attempting to get the state of Kubuntu Documentation back up to par again. Thanks to the amazing Rick Spencer for fitting me into a slot helping out with the Netbook stuff, and for that I will be forever grateful. Hopefully we will have an amazing presentation for the Kubuntu Netbook Edition to show everyone for Karmic.</p>\n<p>So with that, just know that I might be down, but I am not out. I will no longer stick my nose into the politics and bullshit that has knocked me down in the past, but I will put my nose to the grind stone and continue working on making Kubuntu #1 anyway that I can. I apologize if I have neglected any email from you in the past. I am working on fixing all of that and it will take a little bit of time. I also apologize for making some commitments and not following through on them. I have contacted most of you on this already. I regret that I have to turn down any requests outside of Kubuntu and KDE to help you, but that is how it has to be right now. I am currently working on repriortizing a bunch of things so in the future I am sure I will be able to lend you a hand, so don&#8217;t hesitate to keep in touch. My number one priorities right now are obtaining stable employment as this consulting crap is for the birds and continue my cycling adventures. Cycling has helped clear my mind to levels I could never imagine. I guess 300 miles a week can do that to a person <img src=\"http://blog.nixternal.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p>\n<p>Thanks to those of you who provided support and the confidence I needed in order to try and continue on, and thank you to everyone who has sent many well wishes and to those who messaged me on IRC and listened to me whine.

Part of the reason is to learn some of these technologies and part of it is to get some better tech to replace what they have.</p>\n<p>Today I was reminded of a comment made at the BLU some years back, it went along the lines of &#8220;Why would a server vendor or tools developer attempt to make the tool any easier to use, when most of the time it&#8217;s installing and servicing that pays their wages.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Put simply, because there is no money in the development task it&#8217;s self, that developers would either deliberately make services hard to exploit without massive amounts of educational investment or would simply fail to provide the best and most well designed tools to interface to their creations. That also goes for writing easy to understand documentation.</p>\n<p>On the other hand is it just that server tool developers just aren&#8217;t very good at designing APIs and text based UI? Perhaps the culture is just that nothing needs designing and tools can be put together however which way to best suite the original developers modus.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to think of most developers as breaking their creations deliberately, but it&#8217;s relativity easy to think about developers as not the most artistic or empathetic group. This is why I think there are so many web based gui front ends like webmin and others that spring up to fill the need and why part of what will make the Ubuntu Server distro grow in places is availability and automatic ease of use of the required toolsets.</p>\n<p>What are your thoughts? Are you an experienced sys-admin or are you someone who has been put off from learning something new because of the complexity of the tools? Do you find official documentation lacking? Do you think some developers are making their money by making their software feature rich but hard to implement?</p>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/doctormo.wordpress.com/994/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/doctormo.wordpress.com/994/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/doctormo.wordpress.com/994/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/doctormo.wordpress.com/994/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/doctormo.wordpress.com/994/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/doctormo.wordpress.com/994/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/doctormo.wordpress.com/994/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/doctormo.wordpress.com/994/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/doctormo.wordpress.com/994/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/doctormo.wordpress.com/994/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=doctormo.wordpress.com&amp;blog=6486156&amp;post=994&amp;subd=doctormo&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" /></div>	") (pubDate nil "Fri, 07 Aug 2009 22:53:58 +0000") (dc:creator nil "doctormo")) (item nil (title nil "Launchpad News: Code Hosting quick-start guide") (guid nil "http://blog.launchpad.net/?p=923") (link nil "http://blog.launchpad.net/code/code-hosting-quick-start-guide") (description nil "\n	<img class=\"face\" src=\"http://planet.ubuntu.com/heads/launchpad-heading.png\" alt=\"\">\n<p>If you want to host code on Launchpad, and you need some help, you can turn to IRC, the launchpad-users mailing list or the <a href=\"https://help.launchpad.net/Code\">Code Hosting section on the help wiki</a>.</p>\n<p>If all you want, though, is to get up and running with hosting your project&#8217;s code on Launchpad, there&#8217;s now a <a href=\"https://help.launchpad.net/Code/QuickStart\">quick-start guide</a>.

Yesterday, Leann Ogasawara, our Ubuntu kernel QA lead, addressed a roomful of Ubuntu developers.  She shared how the kernel team is handling this situation, and asked for ideas and suggestions from the crowd.</p>\n<p>To try to help out, I reviewed the most recent screenful of kernel bug reports (75) to see if there were any patterns we could take advantage of.  I discussed with the kernel team some ways in which we could improve our approach, and implemented some of the changes.</p>\n<p>Altogether, this was only a few hours of work, but should eliminate a large number of invalid reports, and significantly increase the quality of many more.</p>\n<p>A quick back-of-the-envelope count revealed the following categories:</p>\n<h3>Suspend or hibernate failures (36%)</h3>\n<p>A majority of these are automated reports from apport.  This is good, because we have the opportunity to collect relevant information from the system when the problem happened, but it also means that there are <em>a lot</em> of reports.</p>\n<p>Although some new logging was added in 9.04, these reports still often do not contain enough information to diagnose the problem.</p>\n<p>One bit of data which the kernel team has said would be useful is the frequency of the failure: does it fail every time, or only sometimes?  We can improve the logging to keep track of <em>successful</em> resumes as well as failures, and then include this data in the report.</p>\n<h3>Networking problems, both wired and wireless (13%)</h3>\n<p>The kernel team has a <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/specs/KernelKarmicImprovingWifi\">partial specification</a> for some improvements to make here.</p>\n<h3>Package installation and upgrade failures (10%)</h3>\n<p>The kernel tends to be a trigger point for a variety of problems in this area which are not its fault.  For example, if the system is very low on disk space, upgrading the kernel can fail because it is a large package, so we automatically suppress those reports.  In my sample, <em>none</em> of the failures being reported against the kernel actually belonged there.</p>\n<p>To help address this, we can suppress bogus reports, and redirect valid reports to the appropriate package.  I committed fixes to apport which will file the problem reports against <a href=\"http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu/karmic/apport/ubuntu/revision/1475\">grub</a> or <a href=\"http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu/karmic/apport/ubuntu/revision/1476\">initramfs-tools</a> if they were caused by failures in update-grub or update-initramfs respectively.  I also added an <a href=\"http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-bugcontrol/apport/ubuntu-bugpatterns/revision/25\">apport bug pattern</a> to suppress bug reports against the kernel which contained certain dpkg unpacking errors, and added a <a href=\"http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/apt/ubuntu/revision/1717\">patch to apt</a> to try to detect this case as well.</p>\n<h3>Audio-related problems (9%)</h3>\n<p>Currently, the first step for most of these bug reports is to <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/KernelTeamBugPolicies\">ask the user to complete the report</a> by running <tt>apport-collect -p alsa-base</tt> to collect audio-related debugging data.</p>\n<p>Because they account for a significant proportion of all kernel bugs, I committed an <a href=\"http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-core-dev/ubuntu/karmic/apport/ubuntu/revision/1478\">apport patch</a> to simply attach this information by default for all kernel bugs.</p>\n<h3>Kernel panics, oopses, lockups etc. (8%)</h3>\n<p>These bugs are notoriously tricky to file properly, because the system is often non-functional or severely impaired.</p>\n<p>In Karmic, we now have a <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelTeam/CrashdumpRecipe\">kernel crash dump facility</a> which is very easy to use.  Rather than reporting a bug saying &#8220;my computer locks up&#8221;, you can throw a switch which will enable the problem to be automatically detected, recorded and analyzed.  By the time the bug report reaches the kernel developers, it should have detailed information about where the problem occurred, rather than requiring the reporter to use things like digital cameras to capture panic messages.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also wired up <a href=\"http://www.kerneloops.org/\">kerneloops</a> to apport, so that oopses are reported through an automatic facility which can produce a more complete bug report.</p>\n  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/mdzlog.wordpress.com/587/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/mdzlog.wordpress.com/587/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/mdzlog.wordpress.com/587/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/mdzlog.wordpress.com/587/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/mdzlog.wordpress.com/587/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/mdzlog.wordpress.com/587/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/mdzlog.wordpress.com/587/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/mdzlog.wordpress.com/587/\" /></a> <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/mdzlog.wordpress.com/587/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/mdzlog.wordpress.com/587/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=mdzlog.alcor.net&amp;blog=4533171&amp;post=587&amp;subd=mdzlog&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" /></div>	") (pubDate nil "Fri, 07 Aug 2009 10:10:21 +0000") (dc:creator nil "mdz")) (item nil (title nil "Dustin Kirkland: Moving your Encrypted Home Meta Data out of /var/lib/ecryptfs") (guid nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3822757291061444396.post-8973702756898269198") (link nil "http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/08/moving-your-encrypted-home-meta-data.html") (description nil "\n	<img class=\"face\" src=\"http://planet.ubuntu.com/heads/kirkland.png\" alt=\"\">\nIn the spirit of the <a href=\"http://www.pathname.com/fhs/\">FHS</a>, Encrypted Home Directories in Ubuntu 9.04 stored certain configuration information about your Encrypted Home setup in <span>/var/lib/ecryptfs</span>.<span><br /></span><ul><li><span><a href=\"http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#VARLIBVARIABLESTATEINFORMATION\">http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#VARLIBVARIABLESTATEINFORMATION</a></span></li></ul>However \"correct\" this location might be, it has caused considerable pain to a number of users, mostly because people don't backup /var/lib, generally.

What is a Music Player Daemon?</span><br />An application that organizes and plays your music, that can be controlled through various applications that you can actually see and use.

Then Copy in:    gksudo gedit /etc/mpd.conf<br />Change the 8th line<br /><blockquote>music_directory        \"/var/lib/mpd/music/\"</blockquote><br />to point to wherever your music is stored, such as<br /></span></span><span id=\"formatbar_Buttons\"><span class=\"on down\" id=\"formatbar_CreateLink\" title=\"Link\"><blockquote>music_directory        \"/home/your-username/Music\"</blockquote></span></span>Then save it.  By default all users on the machine will get access to play music from the collection.  (You can also enable remote access)<br /><br />Then, hopefully just start up Ario and get playing :)<br /><br />The<a href=\"apt:music-applet\"> music applet </a>(add to your gnome panel) can also control MPD directly, so you can actually close all the other MPD clients after setting up a playlist and just control it through that!<br /><br />But still, I'm not sure if MPD is ready for the non-technical user, so I am going to exclude it from the rest of the review, for now.  Please do share your thoughts if you think otherwise.  If you are a non-techie and love, I'd love to hear that.<br /><br /><div><span><span>Who's left?

So, we moved the frequent snapshot process to a slave database which is always completely up to date with the production master database.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Aside: Having complete backups is not the only reason to do EBS snapshots.  They also increase the reliability and failsafe-ness of the EBS volume itself, so we still run occasional snapshots on the production database, just during off-peak hours.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Steve Caldwell (chief tech at CampusExplorer.com) has automated some great push button EC2 system launches and configurations including EBS database volumes created from snapshots, attached, mounted, etc.  This is convenient to do things like setting up a temporary development system for a contractor, starting a staging environment for QA, or running some database intensive reports on near-production data.</p>\n\n<h2>skip-slave-start</h2>\n\n<p>When EBS volumes were created from the snapshots of the slave database, Steve found that as soon as the MySQL server came up, it started replication from the master thinking it was a slave database.  In some cases this is fine, but in others we want to see the database in exactly the state it was in at the time of the snapshot.  We tried running &#8220;STOP SLAVE&#8221; just before creating the snapshot, but replication still resumed when the server started.  </p>\n\n<p>We finally found the solution in the option <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-options-slave.html#option_mysqld_skip-slave-start\">&#8212;skip-slave-start</a> which tells MySQL to not start the replication process when the server comes up.</p>\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t looked into how to pass options to mysqld when running /etc/init.d/mysql so we settled on adding this line to the <code>[mysqld]</code> section of <code>/etc/mysql/my.cnf</code> by default on our non-slave servers:</p>\n\n<pre><code>skip-slave-start\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>On a system which we know should start as a slave, we omit this directive.  On a system we want to turn into a slave, we simply run &#8220;START SLAVE&#8221; and remove this line for future restarts.  If the binary logs available on the master go back to the point where the snapshot was created, then replication begins and it eventually catches up to the present.</p>\n\n<p>[Update 2009-08-06: Clarify skip-start-slave meaning]</p>\n\n        \n\n    <img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/alestic-planetubuntu/~4/7giIX2tNhX0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />	") (pubDate nil "Fri, 07 Aug 2009 02:10:56 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Eric Hammond")) (item nil (title nil "Martin Owens: Systems Administration: Package Management") (guid nil "http://doctormo.wordpress.com/?p=992") (link nil "http://doctormo.wordpress.com/2009/08/06/systems-administration-package-management/") (description nil "\n	<img class=\"face\" src=\"http://planet.ubuntu.com/heads/doctormo.png\" alt=\"\">\n<div class=\"snap_preview\"><br /><p>This is this weeks course, sleeping problems with all this heat has knocked out the quality on this week.

One of the reasons I&#8217;ve stayed out of the conversation is that I feel that openSUSE <strong>should not offer a choice at all</strong>. Not supporting &#8220;freedom of choice&#8221; is a very controversial position to take in a free software community, but many fail to realise how much &#8220;choice&#8221; can hurt a user. </p>\n<p>The current design places a burden on the user. Two options of seemingly equal importance are presented and the user is asked to make a choice. This choice requires the user to be knowledgeable enough about each option to make a decision. Normally, defaults help guide the user in making a decision. Having one selected by default is helpful, but this &#8220;hint&#8221; is offset by the purposeful neutral presence of an alternative. The list is in alphabetical order and not order of importance and both options have the same visual treatment. How can the user know that the selected option is the best option for them and not simply the first item on the list? This isn&#8217;t very user friendly.  </p>\n<p>An argument might be made that this is a good opportunity for openSUSE to help educate users about the technology choices. However, can that really be done in a 150 word paragraph without screenshots or feature lists? Is this something the user wants to do in the middle of an installation process? Providing such a small amount of information might actually increase the burden, because now the user may realise how little they actually know about the choice they are about to make.</p>\n<p>Additionally, there is <a href=\"http://files.opensuse.org/opensuse/en/e/ec/Survey_openSUSE110.pdf\">evidence</a> which shows that 2/3 of openSUSE&#8217;s userbase are not using the current default. Possibly meaning that during 2/3 of openSUSE installations, users must change the default. This seems unnecessary and inefficient and induces an opportunity for users to make a mistake. This doesn&#8217;t sound very usable.</p>\n<p>What to do? I would remove the burden of choice altogether and provide a single recommendation. A way to change the recommendation can still be implemented for more knowledgeable users, but made unobtrusive to users who do not search for it. I&#8217;ve heard a few concerns about the usability of hiding such an option in an &#8220;Advanced&#8221; menu (a method previously employed), but the method shouldn&#8217;t be discounted just because it has been designed poorly in the past. Fix the problem, don&#8217;t design around it.</p>\n<p>Obviously, I would like to see KDE as the default desktop for openSUSE. <strong>Ethically</strong>, I would rather see openSUSE &#8212; or any distribution for that matter &#8212; fix their design to better support users, regardless of which desktop environment makes the most sense to install by default. In this case, there is evidence that 2/3 of openSUSE&#8217;s users run KDE; &#8212; good reason for selecting KDE by default. Conversely, I wouldn&#8217;t argue for KDE if the numbers were reversed to favor GNOME. I just want to see good design.</p>\n<p>openSUSE has a hard business decision to make. They can continue to support &#8220;freedom of choice&#8221; and continue to burden the user. Or they can assist users by making an <strong>informed</strong> choice for them. </p>\n<p>I support freedom of choice &#8212; when it helps, not hurts. Limiting a user&#8217;s autonomy by paralyzing them with choices doesn&#8217;t sound like a very good user experience. Then again, if openSUSE chooses a default which doesn&#8217;t support 2/3 of their user base, maybe they should just stick with the bad design.</p>	") (pubDate nil "Thu, 06 Aug 2009 16:42:30 +0000") (dc:creator nil "seele")) (item nil (title nil "Stephan Hermann: Puppets way") (guid nil "http://www.sourcecode.de/feeds/shermann/ubuntu/1228 at http://www.sourcecode.de") (link nil "http://www.sourcecode.de/content/puppets-way") (description nil "\n	<img class=\"face\" src=\"http://planet.ubuntu.com/heads/sh.png\" alt=\"\">\n<p>This is the way to configure tomcat6 in puppet...2 hours of work for this and the tomcat6 module behind it...</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<pre class=\"rteleft rteindent1\">\nnode &quot;tomcat01-node&quot; inherits basenode {\n&nbsp; include tomcat6\n&nbsp; tomcat6::add_server { &quot;jvmRouteName&quot;:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ensure =&gt; present\n&nbsp; }\n&nbsp; tomcat6::add_default_config { &quot;tomcat&quot;:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; javaHome =&gt; &quot;SUN&quot;,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java_opts =&gt; [&quot;-Xmx512M&quot;,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;-XX:PermSize=128m&quot;,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;-XX:MaxPermSize=256m&quot;,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;-Dnvserver.configdir=/etc/configSpace/whatever&quot;,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC&quot;,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9003&quot;,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=/etc/tomcat6/jmxremote.password&quot;,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.access.file=/etc/tomcat6/jmxremote.access&quot;,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false&quot;,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false&quot; ],\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; security =&gt; &quot;no&quot;\n&nbsp; }\n&nbsp; tomcat6::add_jmx_user { &quot;opennms&quot;:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; status =&gt; &quot;readonly&quot;\n&nbsp; }\n&nbsp; tomcat6::add_jmx_password { &quot;opennms&quot;:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password =&gt; &quot;OpenNMS&quot;\n&nbsp; }\n\n&nbsp; tomcat6::add_tomcat_role { &quot;admin&quot;: ensure =&gt; present }\n&nbsp; tomcat6::add_tomcat_user { &quot;admin&quot;: ensure =&gt; present, password =&gt; &quot;secret&quot;, roles =&gt; &quot;admin&quot;&nbsp; }\n}\n\n</pre>\n<!--\n<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\" xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\" xmlns:trackback=\"http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/\">\n<rdf:Description rdf:about=\"http://www.sourcecode.de/content/puppets-way\" dc:identifier=\"http://www.sourcecode.de/content/puppets-way\" dc:title=\"Puppets way\" trackback:ping=\"http://www.sourcecode.de/trackback/1228\" />\n</rdf:RDF>\n-->	") (pubDate nil "Thu, 06 Aug 2009 16:33:38 +0000") (dc:creator nil "shermann")) (item nil (title nil "Dustin Kirkland: Migrating to an Encrypted Home Directory") (guid nil "tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3822757291061444396.post-451743978450810143") (link nil "http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/06/migrating-to-encrypted-home-directory.html") (description nil "\n	<img class=\"face\" src=\"http://planet.ubuntu.com/heads/kirkland.png\" alt=\"\">\n<a href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-mej0A6dVeU/Siak1fmnekI/AAAAAAAAATE/A9v7P0hxa-Q/s1600-h/lock.jpg\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-mej0A6dVeU/Siak1fmnekI/AAAAAAAAATE/A9v7P0hxa-Q/s320/lock.jpg\" alt=\"\" id=\"BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5343139246845164098\" border=\"0\" /></a>Howdy!<br /><br />Many eCryptfs and Ubuntu Jaunty users have requested instructions on migrating their existing, non-encrypted home directories to an Encrypted-Home setup.

If you have a large home directory, this step might take a very long time.  Be very wary of any errors at this point.  This is the most essential step in this migration scheme.  I usually re-run this step 3 times.  <pre><br />rsync -aP --exclude=.Private --exclude=Private --exclude=.ecryptfs \\<br />$HOME/ $HOME/Private/<br /></pre><br /><br />Sync to disk, unmount, logout, and log back in.  <pre><br />sync &amp;&amp; sync &amp;&amp; sync<br />ecryptfs-umount-private<br />exit<br />login<br /></pre><br /><br />Setup your eCryptfs configuration directory.  <pre><br />ecryptfs-umount-private<br />cd /<br />sudo mkdir -p /home/.ecryptfs/$USER<br />sudo chown $USER:$USER /home/.ecryptfs/$USER<br />mv $HOME/.ecryptfs /home/.ecryptfs/$USER/<br />mv $HOME/.Private /home/.ecryptfs/$USER/<br />sudo chmod 700 /home/.ecryptfs/$USER/.Private /home/.ecryptfs/$USER/.ecryptfs<br /><br /></pre><br /><br />Setup your new, unmounted home directory.  <pre><br />sudo mkdir -p -m 700 /home/$USER.new<br />sudo chown $USER:$USER /home/$USER.new<br />ln -sf /home/.ecryptfs/$USER/.ecryptfs \\<br />/home/$USER.new/.ecryptfs<br />ln -sf /home/.ecryptfs/$USER/.Private \\<br />/home/$USER.new/.Private<br /></pre><br /><br />Move your old, unencrypted home directory out of the way.  <pre><br />sudo mv $HOME $HOME.old<br /></pre><br /><br />\"Activate\" your new, unmounted home directory by renaming it.  <pre><br />sudo mv /home/$USER.new $HOME<br />echo $HOME > $HOME/.ecryptfs/Private.mnt<br />ln -sf \\<br />/usr/share/ecryptfs-utils/ecryptfs-mount-private.txt \\<br />$HOME/README.txt<br />sudo chmod 500 $HOME<br /></pre><br /><br />Logout, and log back in.  Ensure that $HOME is mounted, and that you have a symlink to your configuration directory. <pre><br />exit<br />login<br />mount | grep \"$USER.*ecryptfs\"<br />ln -sf /home/.ecryptfs/$USER/.ecryptfs \\<br />/home/$USER/.ecryptfs<br />ln -sf /home/.ecryptfs/$USER/.Private \\<br />/home/$USER/.Private<br /></pre><br /><br />Check all of your home directory data.  Ensure that everything is in order.  Once you are completely confident that the migration worked, you can reclaim some disk space by removing your old, non-encrypted data.  <pre><br />sudo rm -rf $HOME.old<br /></pre><br /><br /><h2>Notes</h2><br /><br />If you are a shred-minded-individual, you will need to backup your cleartext data, <a href=\"http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/jaunty/en/man1/shred.1.html\">shred</a> your disk, and <a href=\"http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/02/jaunty-encrypted-home-directories.html\">reinstall from scratch</a>.<br /><br />:-Dustin<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3822757291061444396-451743978450810143?l=blog.dustinkirkland.com\" /></div>	") (pubDate nil "Thu, 06 Aug 2009 16:31:57 +0000") (dc:creator nil "Dustin Kirkland (noreply@blogger.com)")) (item nil (title nil "Bryce Harrington: Kernel Mode-setting for open source ATI Graphics") (guid nil "http://www2.bryceharrington.org:8080/84 at http://www2.bryceharrington.org:8080/drupal") (link nil "http://www2.bryceharrington.org:8080/drupal/node/84") (description nil "\n	<img class=\"face\" src=\"http://planet.ubuntu.com/heads/bryce.png\" alt=\"\">\n<p>I've set up a PPA for testing kernel mode-setting (KMS) on -ati:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  <a href=\"https://edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/kms\">https://edge.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+archive/kms</a>\n  </p></blockquote>\n<p>To boot into KMS mode, specify the kernel parameter:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  radeon.modeset=1\n  </p></blockquote>\n<p>Good things to test include compiz, video playback, 3d apps...

It is <strong><em>so</em></strong> much fun to be subjected to 3 breath tests within the space of 10 metres for your entertainment, whilst my calm and patient insistance that you are blocking my driveway is ignored with a stubborn consistancy. The most fun I ever had was the time that you<em><strong> threatened to arrest me</strong></em> for trying to go home &#8212; for refusing to go home.

You know, that narrow driveway that these same people know, from<strong> learned experience</strong>, is to be used <em><strong>solely</strong></em> for the purpose of <em><strong>exiting</strong></em>. The one which they are not able to see your roadblock from, and which is mostly <em><strong>obstructed from view</strong></em> from the road by a brick fence, bins, trees and shrubbery. Yes. That one.</p>\n<p>I feel much better now that I have all that out of my system, but you must excuse me.

Well, I&#8217;ve installed Ubuntu and Boxee on it, and it plays back all kinds of video including 720p and 1080p HD video via the HDMI port. The box is silent enough for it to be in the bedroom and not disturb sleep at all. I had to put my ear right up to it to hear anything, it&#8217;s as good as silent. It can be found for about £150 here in the UK, which is (in my opinion) an awesome price for this bit of kit.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-225\" title=\"Acer Aspire Revo\" src=\"http://popey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/ORD-ACE-REVO-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Acer Aspire Revo\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s its vitals:-</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://popey.com/~alan/revo/cpuinfo\">Intel Atom 230 1.6GHz CPU</a> &#8211; Single core, but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-threading\">HT</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://popey.com/~alan/revo/meminfo\">1GiB of shared memory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://popey.com/~alan/revo/lshwdisk\">160GB (149GiB) 2.5&#8243; Hitachi Disk</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://popey.com/~alan/revo/lshwvideo\">nVidia ION Video Card</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://popey.com/~alan/revo/lshwnet\">Ethernet and WiFi</a></li>\n<li>VGA &amp; HDMI ports</li>\n<li>6 USB ports</li>\n<li>Multi-Memory-Card reader</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Notably missing is bluetooth which I needed for my remote control, but not too much of an issue as bluetooth dongles are <a href=\"http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sku.11866\">super cheap</a> and the box has enough USB ports to go round.</p>\n<p>I wanted to use this device as a kind of &#8220;set top box&#8221; to play back video. The options for software included <a href=\"http://boxee.tv\">Boxee</a>, <a href=\"http://mythbuntu.org\">Mythbuntu</a> and <a href=\"http://xbmc.org/\">XBMC</a> and certainly not <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/mediacenter/default.mspx\">Windows Media Centre</a> as some <a href=\"http://www.hantslug.org.uk/lurker/message/20090802.223246.fb4270a8.en.html\">crackpot</a> on the <a href=\"http://hants.lug.org.uk/\">Hampshire LUG</a> mailing list suggested.</p>\n<p>Below are some notes about how I installed Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic) on the device and got the Sony Playstation 3 remote control working. I chose Ubuntu 9.10 because I knew the video driver for the nVidia ION card was available in the repository, and I feel confident with it.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> At the time of writing, Ubuntu 9.10 is in Alpha stage, that means it breaks. Anyone who tells you it doesn&#8217;t is a liar <img src=\"http://popey.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />  It broke the day I was trying to install, but luckily the people in #ubuntu+1 irc channel helped me get it working again.</p>\n<p>So far I have installed Boxee on top of Ubuntu and have found it great for my needs. Not sure if I&#8217;ll install XBMC because Boxee seems to cover my needs. Also unsure whether or not I&#8217;ll install MythTV on it either as I currently have no major requirement for recording TV and playing back in another room. Maybe later I will, who knows.</p>\n<h2>Installing Ubuntu</h2>\n<p>Download Ubuntu Karmic Alpha 3 Desktop ISO image from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/karmic/alpha-3/</p>\n<p>On my Ubuntu desktop, used USB startup disk creator to make a bootable USB stick containing alpha 3.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://popey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/usb-creator-269x300.png\" alt=\"USB Creator\" title=\"USB Creator\" width=\"269\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-227\" /></p>\n<p>I had a problem that the Karmic Alpha 3 image boots to a text logon prompt, not a GUI. It seems that the open source nv driver that shipped on Alpha 3 image doesn&#8217;t support the NVidia ION chipset inside the Revo. Here&#8217;s what I did to get to the graphical logon screen and then proceed with the install:-</p>\n<p>Login with username &#8216;ubuntu&#8217; and no password</p>\n<p>Attach the Revo to the wired network</p>\n<p>Check I have an ip address with the &#8216;ifconfig&#8217; command</p>\n<p>Update the list of packages</p>\n<pre>sudo apt-get update</pre>\n<p>Install the nVidia proprietary driver version 185 (in the 180 package confusingly)</p>\n<pre>sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-180</pre>\n<p>Grab a known working xorg.conf:-</p>\n<pre>wget http://popey.com/~alan/revo/xorg.conf</pre>\n<p>Put the xorg.conf into place:-</p>\n<pre>sudo cp ./xorg.conf /etc/X11</pre>\n<p>Restart the graphical environment:-</p>\n<pre>sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start</pre>\n<p>Ubuntu desktop starts up at this point, so now we can run the graphical install routine as normal. I created a user which logs in automatically to the desktop because it&#8217;s a set to box, I don&#8217;t want any logon prompts. At the end, reboot and remove the USB stick. Unfortunately I got the text based logon screen again, so did the following to fix it:-</p>\n<p>Logon using the account details I created during the install.</p>\n<pre>sudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get dist-upgrade\nsudo apt-get install dkms\nsudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-180 --reinstall</pre>\n<p>That should permanently fix it. Not sure why DKMS was missing from the Alpha 3 CD.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s it for the Ubuntu install, not too painful at all. The only extra packages I then installed were ones I tend to put on most desktops:-</p>\n<p>$ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras openssh-server pavucontrol mplayer vlc ffmpeg libavcodec-unstripped-52 libavfilter-unstripped-0 libavdevice-unstripped-52 libavformat-unstripped-52</p>\n<p>I used pavucontrol to switch audio output from the headphone jack &#8216;Output Analog Stereo&#8217; to the HDMI port &#8216;Output Digital Stereo (HDMI), which worked with no messing. I note that some people have had issues with audio over HDMI on Ubuntu 9.04, but the good news is it just works out of the box in 9.10.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://popey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Screenshot-Volume-Control-300x240.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-Volume Control\" title=\"Screenshot-Volume Control\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-231\" /></p>\n<p>I then tested video playback using mplayer and VLC. It worked fine, but as those packages in the repo don&#8217;t have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDPAU\">VDPAU</a> support, I wasn&#8217;t able to play back 720p or 1080p at a reasonable pace. However this isn&#8217;t an issue because I then moved on to install Boxee which I know does support it.</p>\n<p>Another issue I noted was a large amount of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overscan\">overscan</a> so the panels top and bottom were off the edge of the screen. This made choosing panel icons tricky at times! Using ALT+F1 I opened the Applications menu, and could navigate pretty much everywhere I needed to from there.</p>\n<h2>Boxee</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a <a href=\"http://boxee.tv\">Boxee</a> account for a while, and tried it out on a few computers. It&#8217;s never really struck me as useful because I can usually playback video via standard desktop tools. However for a set-top box it makes more sense to me to have an easy to use user interface to locally stored and web delivered video. That and it supporting VDPAU out of the box made it an attractive choice for the Revo.</p>\n<p>Boxee have a repository for their application, so it was simply a case of going to System -&gt; Administration -&gt; Software Sources -&gt; Third-Party Software -&gt; Add, and pasting this in:-</p>\n<pre>deb http://apt.boxee.tv jaunty main</pre>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I am running Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic) and that repo is for Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty), so I was expecting failure.</p>\n<p>Indeed, trying to install the boxee package failed because it was looking for a package called liblzo1 which isn&#8217;t available in Karmic. liblzo2-2 is available in 9.10 but that didn&#8217;t work, so I cheated a bit and grabbed <a href=\"http://packages.ubuntu.com/jaunty/i386/liblzo1/download\">liblzo1</a> from 9.04 and installed that. Boxee then proceeded to install just fine.</p>\n<p>Once Boxee is installed there is an item on the Sound &amp; Video menu to start it.</p>\n<p>I enabled hardware acceleration in the Boxee GUI which effectively enables VDPAU. The only other setting to tweak was to configure overscan compensation so that the full picture appears within the TV screen viewing area. Both are very easy to set in Boxee.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://popey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/screenshot004-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot004\" title=\"screenshot004\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-242\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://popey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/screenshot005-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot005\" title=\"screenshot005\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-243\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://popey.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/screenshot0061-300x168.jpg\" alt=\"screenshot006\" title=\"screenshot006\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-244\" /></p>\n<h2>Playstation 3 Bluetooth Remote</h2>\n<p>On advice from <a href=\"http://blog.daviey.com/\">Daviey</a>, my fellow <a href=\"http://podcast.ubuntu-uk.org/\">podcaster</a> and <a href=\"http://mythbuntu.org/\">Mythbuntu</a> developer, I bought a playstation 3 remote.

On the next screen choose &#8216;input service&#8217; then click &#8216;Next&#8217;.This pairs the remote and the Ubuntu install. Next we need to set the device as trusted.</p>\n<p>Right click the blueman applet icon and choose &#8216;Devices..&#8217;. The &#8216;BD Remote Control&#8217; should be listed. Highlight it then press the yellow &#8216;Trust&#8217; icon, and a  yellow star will now appear in the corner of the logo for that device indicating it&#8217;s now trusted. Next we need to configure lirc which isn&#8217;t installed by default:-</p>\n<pre>sudo apt-get install lirc</pre>\n<p>We need to discover which device the BD Remote Control appears as, which we can obtain from /proc/bus/input/devices.</p>\n<pre>$ cat /proc/bus/input/devices\n\n[snip]\n\nI: Bus=0005 Vendor=054c Product=0306 Version=0000\nN: Name=\"PS3 Remote Controller\"\nP: Phys=\nS: Sysfs=/devices/virtual/input/input8\nU: Uniq=\nH: Handlers=kbd event8\nB: EV=3\nB: KEY=80000000 0 700000 1083c100 8c00ea 0 6bc00000 1 0 8000 1102 c0000801 801680 0 0 10000ffe</pre>\n<p>Note the &#8216;Handlers&#8217; for the PS3 Remote Controller. We need to configure the with that device name by editing the config:-</p>\n<pre>sudo nano /etc/lirc/hardware.conf</pre>\n<p>Add these lines (changing &#8216;event8&#8242; if appropriate):-</p>\n<pre>REMOTE=\"ps3\"\nREMOTE_DRIVER=\"devinput\"\nREMOTE_DEVICE=\"/dev/input/event8\"</pre>\n<p>Finally we restart lirc.</p>\n<pre>sudo /etc/init.d/lirc restart</pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s it. I can now &#8216;type&#8217; into Ubuntu using the buttons on the remote. The arrows map to the cursor keys, the Enter button maps to the Enter key on the keyboard. It&#8217;s all good.

I was immediately intrigued. The original book is one of my all time favorites and I wanted to see if a graphic adaptation could do it justice.

Books are banned and are the target of the firemen’s activity. One day, Montag meets a person who intrigues him with her joie de vivre. He has never met anyone so alive and vibrant and he wonders why. He also begins to look at his own life and realizes he is not happy, that there is something missing. The rest of the tale revolves around his struggle to find meaning in a sterile, inoffensive world where everything is brought down to a common denominator of homogeneous agreeability. I won’t spoil your enjoyment by revealing more than that.</p>\n<p>Those of us who know the story well will note a few details are missing from this adaptation. Like when a movie is made, in this graphic novel it appears that some details of the written story were sacrificed to enable a cleaner telling in the new medium. Again, to avoid spoilers I won’t mention here what has been left out, but I will say that the overall structure and message remain intact and the story does not suffer from the loss.

The artist chose a wonderful style to convey the emotion and action that is reminiscent of the minimalism of 1940s propaganda art, with a limited color palate on each page and just enough detail to convey the main point. Please don’t read that to mean the art is simple or simplistic. On the contrary, Hamilton does an amazing job of choosing which details are most important and distilling the scenes down to only those which further the plot, emotion, or scene. Extraneous information is nowhere to be seen. That can only be by design and due to the disciplined intent of the artist. Detail that is useful is everywhere, and throughout the book the art complements the text beautifully while taking nothing away from it. That is an achievement.</p>\n<p>I confess, I am a reader. I always have several books being read concurrently, stashed here and there for convenience. Fahrenheit 451 is a book I have read several times and which I love. I admit there was some trepidation when I heard about it being adapted into a new form. In this case, none was needed. I am not only pleased by the quality of the graphic novelization, but happy to recommend it. In fact, this makes me want to request a few other classic novels to be adapted, not as replacements, but as introductions to whet the appetites of the curious in the hopes of satisfying their initial curiosity about the works as well as convince some who might not otherwise to delve in and read the originals. Now, I wonder where I put the publisher’s email address?</p>\nShare and Enjoy:\n<a rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"stumbleupon\" target=\"_blank\"

To be honest, it started out as a bit of a filler event because we didn’t have a speaker, but upon mentioning the possibility the response I got was very positive. I started planning the event last month, gathered a few experts who I communicated with via email prior to the event to plan the basics and bounce questions off each other. <a href=\"http://marzke.net/lee/\">Lee Marzke</a>, our VMWare expert, was particularly helpful with planning, deploying a shared plone site for us to post our screenshots and notes on. Thanks Lee!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lists.netisland.net/archives/plug/plug-2009-08/msg00085.html\">The announcement</a> outlines the basics the event. Aside from experts on VMWare, Xen and VirtualBox, the plan was to have a guided discussion on virtualization basics, the benefits, challenges and downfalls of implementations with frequent breaks for general Q&A about virtualization.</p>\n<p>The result? Success! Not only did we have a very impressive turn out of 25 people (our standard meeting for that PLUG chapter is about 10, our biggest meeting until Tuesday night was 14), the discussion was very lively and engaging and I’ve received several positive emails post-event saying that it was enjoyable and they intend to attend talks in the future.</p>\n<p>Here are my notes from the event, for my own reference and in case someone else wants to run something similar:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 hour is not nearly enough. We nudged past the 1.5 hour mark and it still was a bit rushed in places and didn’t cover everything I wanted to cover. Next time shoot for 2 hours and make sure the moderator is able to keep things on track.</li>\n<li>Even though it’s a discussion, we did have a structure:</li>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction to virtualization, general questions, what are people attending interested in?</li>\n<li>Introduction to VMWare, Xen and VirtualBox, demos and questions</li>\n<li>General discussion – success stories, failures, standard dos and don’ts</li>\n</ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://princessleia.com/plug/virtualization_slides.odp\">Slides!</a> The slides I wrote are very basic, giving me a visual focal point for introducing the roundtable, giving people an overview and in general driving home “this is an all level roundtable – speak up, participate, no question is dumb” etc. Our roundtable was so successful activity-wise that we stopped using the slides after the introduction, but if this wasn’t the case it would have been useful to have them to refocus the discussion.</li>\n<li>I had intended to only devote 5 minutes each to a quick intro to VMWare, Xen and VirtualBox, but after questions were added and two of us ended up doing live demos, this turned into 10-15 minutes each! Oops, plan accordingly next time.</li>\n<li>I’m confident that my choice of VMWare, Xen (.org – not Citrix) and VirtualBox for the showcased applications was spot on. On the surface they are competitive virtualization technologies, but upon closer inspection they really serve different segments of the market. It was fascinating during the discussion to see what different people were interested in, the modern hardware requirement and monetary investment in VMWare with all the bells and whistles certainly was of interest for some, while others cheered when I admitted that my first Xen server was hosted on a Pentium 3.</li>\n<li>The roundtable format was great since it gave us the opportunity to invite free-form questions from people completely new to virtualization as well as welcome virtualization industry leaders like <a href=\"http://michael.thegrebs.com/\">Mike Greb</a> of <a href=\"http://www.linode.com/\">Linode</a> to offer their expertise.</li>\n<li>The roundtable format was less great because you really need a good moderator guiding discussion and making sure all the vital points were hit upon. This was my first time hosting something like this, so I think there were a couple of tangents and I probably could have handled some of the transitions more gracefully. Oh, and going over by a half hour wasn’t fantastic, but people did still seem engaged and interested in talking even that late.</li>\n<li>Have fun and be positive! I’m a huge believer that excitement is infectious. I totally geeked out over the usefulness of CLI Xen commands and the flexibility of the technology. Our VMWare expert was equally as excited and confident about the product he was presenting on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, a huge thanks to <a href=\"http://coredial.com/\">CoreDial</a> for being such a great host (for a year now!), and this time a specific Thank You to<a href=\"http://mcallister.ws/\">Kevin McAllister</a> who took over being the CoreDial employee host this month from Danita Fries. He spent lots of time and effort finding and bringing in chairs for all the people who ended up showing up and squeezing into the conference room. Thanks Kevin!

I started planning the event last month, gathered a few experts who I communicated with via email prior to the event to plan the basics and bounce questions off each other. <a href=\"http://marzke.net/lee/\">Lee Marzke</a>, our VMWare expert, was particularly helpful with planning, deploying a shared plone site for us to post our screenshots and notes on. Thanks Lee!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://lists.netisland.net/archives/plug/plug-2009-08/msg00085.html\">The announcement</a> outlines the basics the event. Aside from experts on VMWare, Xen and VirtualBox, the plan was to have a guided discussion on virtualization basics, the benefits, challenges and downfalls of implementations with frequent breaks for general Q&#038;A about virtualization.</p>\n<p>The result? Success! Not only did we have a very impressive turn out of 25 people (our standard meeting for that PLUG chapter is about 10, our biggest meeting until Tuesday night was 14), the discussion was very lively and engaging and I&#8217;ve received several positive emails post-event saying that it was enjoyable and they intend to attend talks in the future.</p>\n<p>Here are my notes from the event, for my own reference and in case someone else wants to run something similar:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 hour is not nearly enough. We nudged past the 1.5 hour mark and it still was a bit rushed in places and didn&#8217;t cover everything I wanted to cover. Next time shoot for 2 hours and make sure the moderator is able to keep things on track.</li>\n<li>Even though it&#8217;s a discussion, we did have a structure:</li>\n<ol>\n<li>Introduction to virtualization, general questions, what are people attending interested in?</li>\n<li>Introduction to VMWare, Xen and VirtualBox, demos and questions</li>\n<li>General discussion &#8211; success stories, failures, standard dos and don&#8217;ts</li>\n</ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://princessleia.com/plug/virtualization_slides.odp\">Slides!</a> The slides I wrote are very basic, giving me a visual focal point for introducing the roundtable, giving people an overview and in general driving home &#8220;this is an all level roundtable &#8211; speak up, participate, no question is dumb&#8221; etc. Our roundtable was so successful activity-wise that we stopped using the slides after the introduction, but if this wasn&#8217;t the case it would have been useful to have them to refocus the discussion.</li>\n<li>I had intended to only devote 5 minutes each to a quick intro to VMWare, Xen and VirtualBox, but after questions were added and two of us ended up doing live demos, this turned into 10-15 minutes each! Oops, plan accordingly next time.</li>\n<li>I&#8217;m confident that my choice of VMWare, Xen (.org &#8211; not Citrix) and VirtualBox for the showcased applications was spot on. On the surface they are competitive virtualization technologies, but upon closer inspection they really serve different segments of the market. It was fascinating during the discussion to see what different people were interested in, the modern hardware requirement and monetary investment in VMWare with all the bells and whistles certainly was of interest for some, while others cheered when I admitted that my first Xen server was hosted on a Pentium 3.</li>\n<li>The roundtable format was great since it gave us the opportunity to invite free-form questions from people completely new to virtualization as well as welcome virtualization industry leaders like <a href=\"http://michael.thegrebs.com/\">Mike Greb</a> of <a href=\"http://www.linode.com/\">Linode</a> to offer their expertise.</li>\n<li>The roundtable format was less great because you really need a good moderator guiding discussion and making sure all the vital points were hit upon. This was my first time hosting something like this, so I think there were a couple of tangents and I probably could have handled some of the transitions more gracefully. Oh, and going over by a half hour wasn&#8217;t fantastic, but people did still seem engaged and interested in talking even that late.</li>\n<li>Have fun and be positive! I&#8217;m a huge believer that excitement is infectious. I totally geeked out over the usefulness of CLI Xen commands and the flexibility of the technology. Our VMWare expert was equally as excited and confident about the product he was presenting on.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, a huge thanks to <a href=\"http://coredial.com/\">CoreDial</a> for being such a great host (for a year now!), and this time a specific Thank You to<a href=\"http://mcallister.ws/\">Kevin McAllister</a> who took over being the CoreDial employee host this month from Danita Fries. He spent lots of time and effort finding and bringing in chairs for all the people who ended up showing up and squeezing into the conference room. Thanks Kevin! And thanks to everyone who attended and participated.</p>	") (pubDate nil "Fri, 14 Aug 2009 02:45:20 +0000") (dc:creator nil "pleia2"))) ("Bryce Harrington: Greasemonkey Stockreplies script improvements" "<img class=\"face\" src=\"http://planet.ubuntu.com/heads/bryce.png\" alt=\"\">\n<p>I've added a couple enhancements to the <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/Specs/PackageGreasemonkeyScripts\">stock-reply script</a>.</p>\n<p>There's now a capability to automatically substitute a few parameters into your comments:  PROJECTNAME, BUGNUMBER, PKGNAME, and REPORTER.</p>\n<p>This makes it possible to write a stock reply like this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\nHi REPORTER,</p>\n<p>Thanks for helping to make PROJECTNAME better by filing this bug report against PKGNAME, however there is not yet enough information to begin analysis.
