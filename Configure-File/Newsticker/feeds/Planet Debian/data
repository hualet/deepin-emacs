I stopped it pretty quickly as it is already pretty annoying to receive a parade of tweets; it is more annoying when it is a shouting match.</p>\n<p>The content of the argument, however, was interesting. I had posted a short excerpt from RMS musings about how the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pirate-party.html\">Pirate Party position backfires on free software</a></p>\n<p>I posted an abbreviated version of the following:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n“I could support a law that would make GPL-covered software’s source code available in the public domain after 5 years, provided it has the same effect on proprietary software’s source code. After all, copyleft is a means to an end (users’ freedom), not an end in itself. And I’d rather not be an advocate for a stronger copyright.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Jeremy was kind enough to take the argument off the 140 character twitterverse and post a <a href=\"http://www.tmttlt.com/2009/07/30/my-current-perspective-on-copyright-creative-commons-and-copyleft/\">thoughtful response</a>. His stance is that copyleft and CC are actually part of the problem—representing some wimpy band-aid that does nothing to solve the problem of copyright and perhaps make it worse because it sanctions copyright as appropriate. In his own words:</p>\n<blockquote><p>However, because people can license things under copyright and ‘give them away’ or enter into other terms of contract.  There is no felt necessity for resolving the real problem of copyright.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I respectfully but totally disagree. It is not that I inherently value the legal counter-power that copyleft licenses represents. It is just when viewed in historical context, copyleft was and is still no band-aid . A better metaphor is it was the tourniquet that saved the life of software, whose life was being slowly but surely suffocated by the mighty weight of IP law.</p>\n<p>When  RMS came up with his legal hack, there was literally a hundred year train (really older) barreling in one direction, going 1000 milers per hour whose sole purpose was to make property out of everything—software, seeds, modified bacteria, NBA scores–a trend that went nearly unabated through the 1980s and 1990s. One was not going to stop that mighty train and the 1000 pound gorilla (aka the trade associations) riding/driving the train. Indeed, Lessig made a valiant attempt at slowing down the train with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft\">Eldred</a> and failed miserably (no fault of his)—so much so—that the court was not even split on the decision. It was overwhelmingly unwilling to stop the march on congress that allowed for greater and greater term extensions!</p>\n<p>At the time Stallman took action, there was little to no room in the court of policy, in the court of law, and in the court of traditional politics to do much of anything to fix the problem. If he had waited ten years, I would not be publishing this entry on Word Press but some gawd awful proprietary system, probably run by AOL or something.</p>\n<p>So Stallman fixed the problem as a hacker might: he understood the system so well, he used it to undermine it and take it down a different path.</p>\n<p>Which gets me to my second point: when it comes to CC licenses, it is certainly the case that these might indeed affirm copyright as there is no clear standard of freedom. Further the language that Lessig likes to uphold as well as that of “choice,” which creeps close to a neoliberal ideology. This has been magnificently critiqued by lawyers, notably by <a href=\"http://law.haifa.ac.il/faculty/eng/elkin.htm\">Niva Elkin Koren in her piece Exploring Creative Commons: a Skeptical View of a Worthy Pursuit</a> and Free Software advocate <a href=\"http://mako.cc/writing/toward_a_standard_of_freedom.html\">Mako Hill…</a>.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the copyleft, I in fact don’t think it upholds copyright in any meaningful way.  In fact, it signals the complete opposite. Now, I am going to dip into a little Derrida, which I hope does not deter some of the geeky readers.  On the whole I can’t understand the guy but he has some great insights, when my brain can get it and I do my best to make him palpable. </p>\n<p>One of his points is that naturalized proposition (like heterosexuality or until recently copyright) or social fact both presupposes and ultimately propagates what it excludes (also explored by <a href=\"http://www.theory.org.uk/ctr-butl.htm\">Judy B as I like to call her</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gold.ac.uk/anthropology/staff/d-graeber/\">David Graeber</a>).  </p>\n<p>It is just this structural quality of language and cultural concepts that Richard Stallman exploited when he established the first F/OSS license, the GPL. What is important to highlight is that while mainstream copyright discourse and related IP laws necessarily presuppose their opposition, they lack any meta-pragmatic indication of this presupposition. Most of copyright’s recent legal history represents a vehement disavowal, through economic incentive theory, of oppositional entailment of the copyright. The GPL more clearly speaks a meta-pragmatic commentary on its oppositional existence, an awareness even built into its informal name: copyleft, which explicitly indexes “copyright.” That is, it is created in direct opposition to copyright even if it makes use of it, which is why in the end, it does not serve the purpose, aim, or content of copyright. </p>\n<p>In an essay on the law, “The Force of the Law: The Mystical Foundation of Authority” Derrida also makes the point that law is respected not because it is just, though it can be, but because it inherently carries with it a whole lot of authority, sanctioned by state power and all sorts of small and large acts (getting a ticket, getting thrown in jail) which keeps us all in our legal place. It also takes a whole lot of (effing draining, deflating) effort and gobs of money to challenge a law, which is one reason it carries this authority (his argument is far more sophisticated but I think you get the gist).</p>\n<p>I would add that constitutional laws, like copyright, are doubly more authoritative as it they are buoyed by the foundation story/myth what have you of this country. That is, there is law, and there is Law, and Constitutional Law is of the latter kind. </p>\n<p>And yet, RMS questioned or deflated the very authority of the law, which is precisely what was so transgressive and exciting about his actions.  He took a a Constitutional mandate and redirected without the courts, without the judges, and for the most part without the lawyers (he, of course, used Eben Moglen’s help to draft the language). </p>\n<p>Derrida, drawing on Walter Benjamin, notes how the figure of the criminal inspires and garners our attention, admiration, and awe, because he stands outside of the law and thus also reveals the violence of the law—or the ways in which we are all bound by the law whether we like it or not. Now, Stallman is no criminal. But in creating the copyleft, RMS did some violence to copyright, demonstrating its oppression (as applied) and another path, again without going through the usual legal paths. </p>\n<p>This is not to say that his path or that of CC are the only ones or the best one’s for IP in the future. This is not to say that all is peachy in Copyleft-Landia. I take seriously <a href=\"http://www.wcl.american.edu/faculty/jaszi/\">Peter Jaszi’s</a> critique that a legal counter power might rob the argumentative power for fair use.</p>\n<p>I, for one, would like shorter copyright’s for all sorts of media and genres. I want the type of fair use where I can include this<a href=\"http://gabriellacoleman.org/blog/?p=1378\"> photo </a> in my forthcoming article and not think twice about it. And I would looooooooooove a policy or legal or traditional grassroots movement that would kick some serious ass in Congress or the courts. And indeed, having a vibrant example to turn to in the form of CC/Copyelft, is perfect ammunition for whatever traditional political path may crop up. I don’t think that its existence automatically entails death of or for the politics of fair use or any other anti-copyright measures. One must be crafty about how to conjoin various streams and movements because in the end, a diverse political ecology is what we need instead of a political mono-culture.  </p>\n<p>This is also not to say policy and traditional politics are not powerful in their own right. It is just in the historical circumstance of the time, when the legal push to make property out of everything was unstoppable, RMS’ solution was/is far more than mere band-aid.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Interprete/~4/0g4hw7nlCCQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /> ") (pubDate nil "Sun, 02 Aug 2009 20:40:15 +0000")) (item nil (title nil "Jonathan McDowell: Back from DebConf9") (guid nil "http://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2009/08/back-from-debconf9.html") (link nil "http://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2009/08/back-from-debconf9.html") (description nil "  <img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/noodles.png\" width=\"110\" height=\"118\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float: right;\">  Finally back home post DebConf9; felt reasonably productive and I have a lengthy todo list which I've even written down and started work on.

Quite the opposite of my experiences with living in Belo Horizonte and Rio de Janeiro. If they at least had good public transport systems =(.</p>\n<p>So, what I wanted to talk about this time is my experience with going to the cinema in there. We went to the cinema to watch the latest Harry Potter movie. The initial experience is pretty much the same - buying tickets and stuff to eat/drink, then entering the room. The first thing I noticed when I went inside was that the room was very small, compared to what you usually have in Brazil. Since this was a somewhat big cinema inside a big shopping mall, I was a bit impressed.</p>\n<p>The movie took a looong time to begin. I believe we had close to 30 minutes of advertising before the movie started. We do have ads in brazilian cinemas, but I believe they usually take no longer than 10 minutes, teasers included. Then we had the usual lecturing about the movie being copyrighted, but the most amusing thing, to me, was that the sign asked us, the audience, to watch our peers, and report anyone who tried to record sound or video; wow.</p>\n<p>The movie was going on pretty okayish, when suddenly a very weird thing happened: someone came from the back of the room with an infra-red binocular, looking at everyone, and then stood at a corner, close to the screen. I thought maybe that was security trying to find someone who had broken into the cinema without buying a ticket, but no, it seems like he was making sure nobody was recording the movie. I guess the UK also has its downsides =/.</p>\n<p>Comments about debconf9 (which was awesome, as always, thanks everyone!) later on =).</p> ") (pubDate nil "Sat, 01 Aug 2009 15:28:31 +0000")) (item nil (title nil "Michael Schultheiss: Home from DebConf 9") (guid nil "http://www.michaelandkrissy.com/99 at http://www.michaelandkrissy.com") (link nil "http://www.michaelandkrissy.com/node/99") (description nil "  <img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/schultmc.png\" width=\"65\" height=\"93\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float: right;\">  <p>I made it back to Indianapolis yesterday evening around 9:00 PM EDT (0300 CEST, 0100 UTC).

There is nothing similar to the static/dynamic linker and  dpkg-shlibdeps/dh_makeshlibs we know from the world of ELF binaries. This might change with Java 7 implementing <a href=\"http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=294\">JSR 294</a> but for now <a href=\"http://maven.apache.org/\">Apache Maven</a> is a build tool that does solve this problem and Maven is widely used in the Java world.<br /><br />We have the maven2 package in Debian for about 2 years now and the current upstream version 2.2.0 in the experimental distribution. But this is not enough to build Debian packages. The most important missing piece is the maven-repo-helper which has been written by Ludovic Claude. It is waiting for about 3 weeks in the NEW queue and that is why several Java packages are in experimental now. Maven-repo-helper implements the <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Java/MavenRepoSpec\">Maven Repository Specification</a> as simple to use debhelper scripts. Please read the <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Java/MavenRepoHelper\">documentation</a> to get an impression how to use it.<br /><br />The package <a href=\"http://wiki.debian.org/Java/MavenBuilder\">maven-debian-helper</a> can be used to actually build packages where upstream is using Maven as its build tool. There is an initial version of maven-debian-helper in Debian based on ant's cdbs snippet but it needs to be updated to use maven-repo-helper to make sure it follows exactly the same repository specification. Shipping 2 packages (maven-repo-helper and maven-debian-helper) is necessary because maven-repo-helper will be used by many package - even ones that use ant instead of maven. Maven-debian-helper on the other side will only be used by maven based packages.<br /><br />The next steps are<br /><ul><li> wait for getting maven-repo-helper, libstax-java, netbeans-cvsclient, and several packages matching maven* and plexus* accepted into the archive<br /></li><li>move packages that Build-Depends: maven-repo-helper from experimental to unstable</li><li>upload a fixed version of maven-debian-helper</li><li>provide debhelper like tools in maven-debian-helper to avoid forcing everyone into cdbs<br /></li><li>use maven-debian-helper for building Maven based packages</li><li>improve documentation<br /></li></ul>Thanks to everyone who helped getting Maven into Debian so far!<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1417262307255204420-2979433928749903121?l=twerner.blogspot.com\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /></div> ") (pubDate nil "Sat, 01 Aug 2009 14:53:39 +0000") (author nil "noreply@blogger.com (Torsten Werner)")) (item nil (title nil "Julien Blache: pommed v1.27: new machines") (guid nil "http://blog.technologeek.org/?p=230") (link nil "http://blog.technologeek.org/2009/08/01/230") (description nil "  <img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/jblache.png\" width=\"65\" height=\"89\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float: right;\">  <p>pommed v1.27 is out as a maintenance release adding support for 3 of the newer machines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MacBook5,2 (White MacBook)</li>\n<li>MacBookPro5,2 (17″ MacBook Pro, June 2009)</li>\n<li>MacBookPro5,5 (13″ MacBook Pro, June 2009)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some machines are still missing, as I haven’t got any report about them yet.</p>\n<p>Looks like the keyboard backlight behaviour and keys handling will have to be modified slightly for the new machines, but it’s really touchy to get right.

I only mentioned this in passing because I was wary of getting bogged down in details.</p>\n<p>In short though I'd like the ability to seamlessly <i>replicate content</i> across machines which I own, maintain, and operate (I will refer to \"storage machines\" as \"client nodes\" to keep in the right theme!)</p>\n<p>In clustering terms there are a few ways you can do this.  One system which I've used in anger has been <tt>drbd</tt>.  <tt>drbd</tt> basically allows you to shares block devices across a network.  This approach has some pros and some cons.</p>\n<p>The biggest problem with <tt>drbd</tt> is that it allows the block device to be mounted at only one location - so you cannot replicate in a live sense.  The fact that it is block-based also has implications on the size of your available storage.</p>\n<p>Moving back to a higher level I'm pretty much decided that when I say that I want \"a replicated/distributed filesystem\" that is precisely what I mean:  The <i>filesystem</i> should be <i>replicated</i>, rather than having the contents split up and shared about in pieces.  The distinction is pretty fine but considering the case of backups this is how you want it to work:  Each client node has a <i>complete</i> backup of the data.  Of course the downside to this is that that maximum storage available is the <i>smallest</i> of the available nodes.</p>\n<p>(e.g. 4 machines with 200Gb of space, and 1 machine of 100gb - you cannot write more than 100Gb to the clustered filesystem in total or the replicated contents will be too large to fit on the smaller host.)</p>\n<p>As a concrete example, given the tree:</p>\n<pre>/shared\n/shared/Text/\n/shared/Text/Articles/\n/shared/Text/Crypted/\n</pre>\n<p>I'd expect that <b>exact tree</b> to be mirrored and readable as a filesystem on the client nodes.  In practise I want a storage node to either be complete, or broken.  I don't want to worry about failure cases when dealing with things like \"A file must be present on 2+ nodes out of the 5 available\".</p>\n<p>Now the cheaty way of doing this is to work like this:</p>\n<pre># modify files\n# for i in client1 client2 client3 ; do \\\n    rsync -vazr --in-place --delete /shared $i:/backing-store ; \\\n  done\n</pre>\n<p>i.e. Just rsync after every change.  The latency would be a killer, and the level of dedication would be super-human, but if you could wire that up in a filesystem you'd be golden.  And this is why I've struggled with lustre, mogilefs, and tahoe.  They provide both real and complicated clustering - but they do not give you a simple filesystem you can pickup and run with from any client node in an emergency.   They're more low-level.  (Probably more reliable, sexy and cool.   I bet they get invited to parties and stuff ;)</p>\n<p>Thankfully somebody has written exactly what I need: <a href=\"http://www.furquim.org/chironfs/index.en.html\">chironfs</a>.  This allows you to spread writes to a single directory over multiple storage directories - each of which gets a complete copy.</p>\n<p>This is the first example from the documentation :</p>\n<pre># make client directories and virtual one\nmkdir /client1 /client2 /real\n\n# now do the magic\nchironfs --fuseoptions allow_other /client1=/client2 /real\n</pre>\n<p>Once you've done this you can experiment:</p>\n<pre>skx@gold:/real$ touch x\nskx@gold:/real$ ls /client1/\nx\nskx@gold:/real$ ls /client2/\nx\nskx@gold:/real$ touch fdfsf\n\nskx@gold:/real$ ls /client1\nfdfsf  x\nskx@gold:/real$ ls /client2\nfdfsf  x\n</pre>\n<p>What this demonstrates is that running \"touch foo\" in the \"/real\" directory resulted in that same operation being carried out in both the directory <tt>/client1</tt> and \"<tt>/client2</tt>\".</p>\n<p>This is looking perfect, but wait <i>it isn't distributed</i>?!</p>\n<p>Thats the beauty of this system if <tt>/client1</tt> &amp; <tt>/client2</tt> are NFS-mounted it works!  Just the way you imagine it should!</p>\n<p>Because I'm somewhat wary of fuse at the moment I've set this up at home - with a \"<tt>/backups</tt>\" directory replicated to an LVM filesystem locally and also to a remote host which is mounted via SSH.</p>\n<p>Assuming it doesn't go mad, lose data, or fail badly if the ssh-based mount disappears I'm going to be very very happy.</p>\n<p>So far it is looking good though, I can see entrie logged like this when I unmount behind its back:</p>\n<pre>2009/07/30 23:28 mknod failed accessing /client2 No such file or directory\n2009/07/30 23:28 disabling replica failed accessing /client2\n</pre>\n<p>So a decent alarm on that would make it obvious when replication was failing - just like the emails that <tt>mdadm</tt> sends out a semi-regular cron-check would probably be sufficient.</p>\n<p>Anyway enough advertising!  So far I love it and I think that if it works out for me in anger that <tt>chironfs</tt> should be part of Debian.

Right off the bat they point to their end user license \"agreement\" and claim that people who bought an iPhone or iPod Touch somehow agreed to this mystical EULA that's somehow signed at point of sale. Nevermind the fact that EULAs are non-negotiable, involve no transfer of title, money, or services, and frequently never even get shown to the user.<br /><br />But enough about that. Apparantly DebConf 10 is going to be in New York City. Right next to where I live. That's great. I didn't go to DebConf this year, despite Arthur Liu recommending it to all the GSoCers. Mostly due to paranoia over airline security and US customs searching my laptop.<br /><br />Debian is apparantly going to actually have release deadlines, albeit every other year as opposed to twice a year like Ubuntu. Still, it's nice to see a commitment to releasing. My first experience with Debian was a while back, when all the worthwhile packages were still in testing.<br /><br />Hopefully, tomorrow I can get Xen working again. Xend won't start, something about an 'invalid dom0 state'. I suspect it has something to do with the fact that NetworkManager manually configures peth0 when it shouldn't, requiring me to fix up the routing tables. Worst comes to worse I'll have to try and run Xen and euca on my desktop, which is just barely compatible with Debian.<br /><br />One of the things I'd like to do for VMbuilder is have it automatically package the Linux kernel and ramdisk into Eucalyptus, if the user opts for it.

It is curious to see how some\nthings happen in a strange <i>related fashion</i>, no matter\nif you believe in $DEITY (superior power or destiny), life\nhas its\nways. Early this week, the new logo of Pepsi was announced\nand some <a href=\"http://img507.imageshack.us/img507/8676/4586.jpg\">comparison</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/pepsi-coke.jpg\">images</a>\nwere created to show the evolution of Pepsi and Coca-Cola\nlogos.

There are a\n<b>lot</b> of people behind <a href=\"http://art.debian.net\">Debian Art</a> and it would be\ngreat to see a joint effort from all artists interested in\nhelping Debian to have a better unified look-and-feel on the\nDebian Project, not only on our web interfaces, but also on\nour products: CDs/DVDs (and its covers), desktops,\nwallpapers, boot loaders, splash screens, documentations,\nbusiness cards, banners, t-shirts (and a bunch of other\nmaterials). It is not just a matter of writing something\ncompletely new without keep in touch with an already\n<b>existent</b> community, it\nis also the need to <b>communicate</b> and push such goals\nproject-wide, so we can have massive adoption.\n<br /><br />\nI was surprised by the fact that a lot of people mixed quite\na few orthogonal points.  Specially the fact that the\nwebsite also needs some work in the Information Architecture\nfield in order to improve the users' experience, but that's\none point of a project-wide concern (that Kalle took into\naccount).\n<br /><br />\nFinally, some may not remember that we <b>vote</b> (General\nResolution) to <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/vote/1999/vote_0004\">choose our\nlogo</a>, back in 1999 (10 years ago).\n<br /><br />\nYes, we need to do better on communicating and we need do to\nbetter with our design (and probably Marketing), but\n<b>please</b> do not start such work by changing our logo.\n</blockquote>\n<cite>Yes... long time since I last post.

It was talking about that the Debian release will propalby get adjusted to match Ubuntu's LTS releases. It isn't a big secret that the next Ubuntu LTS release will be 10.04.

Just to make things clear I want to congratulate her on what she produced. It definitely looks nice and the reactions during the talk were quite clear on that.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But</strong>, there are several issues surrounding this that makes me actually thinking about resigning from the webteam as a whole and reduce my precious time that I invest into Debian. The reason might not be as obvious, but it contains some interesting corner data:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Agnieszka did thank Sledge for his good help. So at least part of the DPL team was aware of it. Some weeks ago Luk, the other part of the DPL team, contacted me and said that he is acting with his DPL team hat on and that there were mails coming in to them about how to create some progress for the website. I told Luk that I am already working on getting Kalle's proposal integrated. It was cool to him and he thanked me and wished me well with the progress, but neither he nor Sledge did tell me anything about Agnieszka's work.</li>\n<li>Agnieszka also did thank stockholm about his help. stockholm is part of the \"marketing\" team (yeah, there was one appointed two years ago; didn't you notice all their great work by now??). Anyway, eventually stockholm have heard about me efforts and did stumble by in #debian-www on IRC. He asked about the new design and who's working on it, I showed him what was there at that time already and all he said was \"Cool\". Again no mentioning of Agnieszka's work neither.</li>\n<li>Like I wrote <a href=\"http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/debian/2009/07/28\">yesterday</a> almost all of the mockups sent in contained only of images (if there even were multiple) which are hard to really decide upon—especially when they are as tiny and not clearly visible like in this presentation. Questions that were raised in the direction of wether this would actually work out were muted with the magic CSS waving; unfortunately CSS can't do magic. And with the images it's hard to decide wether it actually would work for accessibility reasons and the other things I already mentioned yesterday.</li>\n<li>We try very carefully to not have duplication of work in the area of packaging through the terms of ITPs. Great! We try to avoid some few hours invested in an area where we have very well over thousands of contributors. But it seems to be proper to just through away days, weeks, months of invested time, effort and energy in an area that we seriously lack contributors.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Way to go, Debian.

First of all, I'm no longer one of the release\nmanagers. I stepped down after a having a very good time, and agreed to\nhand over the power to the current release managers. A transition of powers\nthat mostly are social engineering powers can only work if one really stops\nusing the powers.\nIf I am only quiet in public when I disagree with the current release\nmanagers, it would be obvious when I agree and disagree.\nSo I must be quiet in public about release decisions all the time, at least\ncurrently (this will hopefully change some time).\n</p><p>\n\nThat doesn't mean I'm not voicing my opinions inside the release team -\nthere I voice them openly, and will continue to do so. But of course I\nrespect the authority of the release managers, granted to them by the\nconstitution, and I will base my own actions on the decisions by the\npersons or bodies empowered through the constitution.\n</p><p>\n\nNow, some people told me I could just voice my opinion as normal developer.\nThough this seems be true, it isn't. Anything I say will always be read as\nthe opinion of the former release manager. I might perhaps return to that\nstate in a few more years time, but as of now, I just cannot.\n</p><p>\n\nNow, my position is quite easy. I could just shut up, and not write this\nblog, and ignore the few people who are directly asking me. For some people\ninside of Debian, this is not possible. For example, the press team has the\ntask to transport the decisions and happenings inside of Debian to the\noutside. So they have, no matter what there own opinions are, to send out a\npress announcement which is positive of the decision.\nTheir only option for not sending out that mail would\nbe to step back. And frankly speaking, I'm really happy with what the\npublicity team has done. They are doing a very good job. Thank you for that.\n</p><p>\n\nPlease remember: It's of course ok to not like the message. But please do\nnot shoot the messenger.

But the chosen cycle is problematic, especially if one considers Ubuntu’s LTS release cycles. The problem is that if Debian releases a new version at approximately the same time as Ubuntu, there will not be much synchronization and Ubuntu will have newer program versions.</p>\n<p>Consider the releases of Ubuntu 8.04 LTS (April 2008) and Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 (February 2009). Whereas Ubuntu 8.04 provides GNOME 2.22 including a new Nautilus, Debian provides GNOME 2.22 with nautilus 2.20. Ubuntu’s release made at about the same time (Ubuntu 9.04) already included GNOME 2.26.</p>\n<p>The reason for this are the different development processes. Whereas a Debian release is based on stable upstream versions, the development of Ubuntu releases happens using newest pre-releases, causing Ubuntu releases to be one generation ahead in most technologies, although released at the same time.</p>\n<p>Another difference is the way of freezing and the duration of the total freeze. Ubuntu has a freeze process split into multiple stages. The freeze which is comparable to Debian’s freeze is the feature freeze, which usually happens two months before the release. Debian’s freeze happens 6 month before the release, just about the time when Ubuntu has just defined the features to be included in the next release.</p>\n<p>Synchronizing the release cycles of Debian and Ubuntu basically means that Ubuntu will always provide the newer features, better hardware support, etc. Ubuntu is the winner of this decision. It will have less bugs because it inherits from a frozen Debian branch and it can include newer versions where required because it freezes 3 months later.</p>\n<p>To synchronize the package versions shipped in Debian and Ubuntu you have to make your release schedules asynchronous, in a way that the Debian release freezes after the Ubuntu release. This basically means that I expect Debian 6.0 (2010/H1) to be more similar to Ubuntu 9.10 than to Ubuntu 10.04. I would have preferred to freeze Squeeze in December 2010 and release in April 2011, and Ubuntu LTS to be re-scheduled for October 2010.</p>\n<p>Now let’s say you are a Debian and Ubuntu user (and you prefer none of them) and you want to setup a new system in 2010/H2 (so the systems have a half year to stabilize). This system should be supported for a long time. You have two options: Debian 6.0 and Ubuntu 10.04. Which will you choose? Most people would probably consider Ubuntu now, because it provides better support for their hardware and has the newer features. A (partial) solution to this problem would be to make backports an official part of Debian starting with Debian 6.0.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there is the question of security support. If we want to provide the ability to upgrade directly from Debian 5.0 to Debian 7.0, we will have to support Lenny until 2012/H2 (to give users enough time to upgrade, when we release 7.0 in 2012/H1). This means that we would have to support in 2012: Debian 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0. And another side effect is that Debian 6.0 would have a 3 year security support, just like Ubuntu 10.04.</p>\n<p>All in all, the decision means that Debian and Ubuntu LTS releases will occur at about the same time, will be supported for about the same time and that Ubuntu has the newer packages and less bugs to fix.</p>\nPosted in Debian, Ubuntu  <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/juliank.wordpress.com/265/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/juliank.wordpress.com/265/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/juliank.wordpress.com/265/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/juliank.wordpress.com/265/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/juliank.wordpress.com/265/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/juliank.wordpress.com/265/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/juliank.wordpress.com/265/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/juliank.wordpress.com/265/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/juliank.wordpress.com/265/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/juliank.wordpress.com/265/\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a> <img src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=juliank.wordpress.com&amp;blog=2363947&amp;post=265&amp;subd=juliank&amp;ref=&amp;feed=1\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></div> ") (pubDate nil "Wed, 29 Jul 2009 12:34:29 +0000")) (item nil (title nil "Alexander Reichle-Schmehl: Playing with statistics..")

Especially given how flexible distributed source control systems are and how long it takes before developers understand <a href=\"http://www.mail-archive.com/dri-devel@lists.sourceforge.net/msg39091.html\">how to use them properly</a>.<br /><br />Most Free Software projects collaborate with external contributors through the use of <a href=\"http://feeding.cloud.geek.nz/2009/06/writing-perfect-patch.html\">patches</a> and with project members through <b>shared source control</b> systems. Keeping a clean source control history in this case can:<ul><li>ease maintenance of the codebase (especially when merging between multiple active branches) and</li><li>facilitate collaboration with other developers who need to quickly grasp what your changes are all about.</li></ul>Here are three things I've put in practice in a few recent projects.<br /><h2>Reduce the noise on the main branch</h2>If you use your source control system in a traditional centralised way, make sure that the main branch has as little noise as possible:<ul><li>use <b>feature branches</b> when developing new functionality (i.e. use one branch per feature)</li><li><b>rebase</b> into a small number of commits instead of merging directly into the main branch (or use something like <tt>git cherry-pick -n</tt> on your commits) </li></ul>It will then be much easier to <b>port these changes across to a different version</b> and to <b>revisit the changes several months later</b>.<br /><h2>Make each commit a logical unit</h2>Ideally, the main branch should be <b>fully usable at any point in its history</b>. For example, if a refactoring commit breaks an existing feature, it should also include any necessary fixes. <i>Progress</i> and <i>fixup</i> commits belong to private branches and should be cleaned up before the code is published on a public repository.<br /><br />A commit shouldn't be too small, but at the same time, it shouldn't be too large. Before pushing a large commit, ask yourself whether or not it could be broken down into <b>smaller or more meaningful units</b>. Introducing a new feature through a number of smaller self-contained units often makes a branch's history much more readable.<br /><h2>Write meaningful commit messages</h2>A commit message will typically be seen along with its patch. Therefore the ideal commit message will include everything which is not immediatly obvious from the code changes:<ul><li>A short <b>description of the new feature</b> it introduces (or how to <b>reproduce the bug</b> it fixes)</li><li>Links to <b>related commits</b> (e.g. \"Fix bug introduced in COMMIT_ID\")</li><li><b>Bug numbers</b> related to this commit</li><li>The <b>main area</b> of the code (or <i>subsystem</i>) that this commit touches (as part of the short description, so that it's easily <i>grep</i>able)</li></ul>Here's an example of a good commit message from version 2.6.29 of the Linux kernel:<br /><blockquote><pre>commit 4869fdea77052c480c54b9e66a927ba036eab29e<br />Author: Mikulas Patocka <br />Date:   Mon Jun 22 10:08:02 2009 +0100<br /><br />dm mpath: validate table argument count<br /><br />commit 0e0497c0c017664994819f4602dc07fd95896c52 upstream.<br /><br />The parser reads the argument count as a number but doesn't check that<br />sufficient arguments are supplied.

"<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/kinnison.png\" width=\"75\" height=\"96\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float: right;\">  <tt>&lt;gushing advert&gt;</tt>\n<p>Over the past week or so, several articles have turned up in such esteemed publications as <a href=\"http://it.slashdot.org/story/09/08/03/2151225/Entropy-Problems-For-Linux-In-the-Cloud?art_pos=5\">Slashdot</a> linking to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2009/07/30/cloud-computing-security-technology-cio-network-cloud-computing.html\">Forbes.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2009/07/black_hat_resea_1.html;jsessionid=PKCJTD402XIXTQE1GHRSKHWATMY32JVN\">Information Week</a> regarding the fact that cloud computers have issues getting at those precious bits of entropy required to secure <span class=\"caps\">SSL</span> transactions and the like.</p>\n<p>Indeed, modern <span class=\"caps\">GNU</span>/Linux distributions, and various other operating systems, rapidly consume the available entropy during normal operations.  Ubuntu 9.04, at least, uses <acronym title=\"Address Space Layout Randomisation\"><span class=\"caps\">ASLR</span></acronym> in order to reduce the effectiveness of attacks since no two shells will have the same layout of address space etc. You can read more about <span class=\"caps\">ASLR</span> on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization\">Wikipedia</a> if you want to. Essentially, <span class=\"caps\">ASLR</span> is done by reading 64 bits of data from <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> during process startup and then using that to seed a <span class=\"caps\">PRNG</span> which is then used to peturb the layout of the dynamically loaded objects in the process. Indeed if the process itself is compiled appropriately then the main executable can be moved about from process start to process start.</p>\n<p>All this, unfortunately, depletes the pool of entropy available to the system. Fortunately <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> continues to work when the pool is depleted, and indeed will not reduce the pool below a threshold value regardless of how much it is used. However this does open the door to the question of whether or not there might be an attack related to causing a server to spawn enough processes that it has insufficient entropy to subsequently establish a good <span class=\"caps\">SSL</span> session or similar.</p>\n<p>Normally a Linux system will gather entropy from such things as the miniscule differences in <span class=\"caps\">HDD</span> response times, interrupts from keyboards and mice, etc.  However a virtual computer (KVM, VMWare, Cloud system etc) doesn’t tend to have a real <span class=\"caps\">HDD</span>, or in many cases, any useful amount of interactivity to produce entropic events to be measured.  This results in cloud computers often having little to no entropy and no real way of gathering more.  Some people believe this leads to being able to predict the random pool of one virtual machine, using the pool of a clone of it.</p>\n<p>When Simtec first started talking about the <a href=\"http://www.entropykey.co.uk/\">Entropy Key</a> we were inundated with people interested in whether or not it’d help for virtual machines.  Initially we assumed it would, but after spending a long time poking at the Linux kernel, at <span class=\"caps\">KVM</span> etc, we determined that unfortunately it wouldn’t usefully help in the state it was in.  So, I spent some time and updated the Entropy Key’s host software to support the <acronym title=\"Entropy Gathering Daemon\"><span class=\"caps\">EGD</span></acronym>‘s protocol, over both unix domain sockets and <span class=\"caps\">TCP</span>.

Ubuntu 9.04, at least, uses <acronym title=\"Address Space Layout Randomisation\"><span class=\"caps\">ASLR</span></acronym> in order to reduce the effectiveness of attacks since no two shells will have the same layout of address space etc. You can read more about <span class=\"caps\">ASLR</span> on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization\">Wikipedia</a> if you want to. Essentially, <span class=\"caps\">ASLR</span> is done by reading 64 bits of data from <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> during process startup and then using that to seed a <span class=\"caps\">PRNG</span> which is then used to peturb the layout of the dynamically loaded objects in the process. Indeed if the process itself is compiled appropriately then the main executable can be moved about from process start to process start.</p>\n\n<p>All this, unfortunately, depletes the pool of entropy available to the system. Fortunately <tt>/dev/urandom</tt> continues to work when the pool is depleted, and indeed will not reduce the pool below a threshold value regardless of how much it is used. However this does open the door to the question of whether or not there might be an attack related to causing a server to spawn enough processes that it has insufficient entropy to subsequently establish a good <span class=\"caps\">SSL</span> session or similar.</p>\n\n<p>Normally a Linux system will gather entropy from such things as the miniscule differences in <span class=\"caps\">HDD</span> response times, interrupts from keyboards and mice, etc.  However a virtual computer (KVM, VMWare, Cloud system etc) doesn’t tend to have a real <span class=\"caps\">HDD</span>, or in many cases, any useful amount of interactivity to produce entropic events to be measured.  This results in cloud computers often having little to no entropy and no real way of gathering more.  Some people believe this leads to being able to predict the random pool of one virtual machine, using the pool of a clone of it.</p>\n\n<p>When Simtec first started talking about the <a href=\"http://www.entropykey.co.uk/\">Entropy Key</a> we were inundated with people interested in whether or not it’d help for virtual machines.  Initially we assumed it would, but after spending a long time poking at the Linux kernel, at <span class=\"caps\">KVM</span> etc, we determined that unfortunately it wouldn’t usefully help in the state it was in.  So, I spent some time and updated the Entropy Key’s host software to support the <acronym title=\"Entropy Gathering Daemon\"><span class=\"caps\">EGD</span></acronym>‘s protocol, over both unix domain sockets and <span class=\"caps\">TCP</span>.  This, along with another simple tool which can connect to an <span class=\"caps\">EGD</span> socket and push entropy into the Linux random pool, means that we have an, admittedly network-reliant, excellent way to push entropy from one host with a physical Entropy Key, to one or more systems for use in their random pools.</p>\n\n<p>When the Entropy Key is released, the host software will be released as free software (under the <span class=\"caps\">MIT</span> licence) and as such we hope that if anyone else has any cool ideas, for helping with getting entropy to cloud computers, they will send patches.

Note that you\nwill need <code>chanact</code> 0.5.11, which is part of\n<code>irssi-scripts</code> since version 20090810.</p>\n<p>I identified three types of channels in terms of the activity\nlevel I cared about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the vast majority of channels, which I wanted to ignore</li>\n<li>a few channels where I wanted to see real activity</li>\n<li>an even smaller number of channels where I also wanted to see\nactivity generated by people joining and leaving.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In all three cases, I still wanted to see highlights, but those\nseem to be handled somewhat differently anyway, so I didn’t have to\nworry abou them.</p>\n<p>The following three settings achieved what I want:</p>\n<pre><code>settings = {\n  […]\n  \"perl/core/scripts\" = {\n    […]\n    chanact_filter = \"3\";\n    chanact_filter_windowlist_level = \"2\";\n    chanact_filter_windowlist = @QUERIES #vcs-pkg #debian.ch,1\n  };\n};\n</code>\n</pre>\n<p>The effects of these three are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>channel activity is ignored by default (filter level 3);</li>\n<li>windows listed in <code>chanact_filter_windowlist</code> are\ntreated with filter level 2, instead…</li>\n<li>… unless they append a specific filter-level after the name,\nusing a comma as separator.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So in the above, I would get to see activity for\n<code>#vcs-pkg</code> and all queries, and I would get to see joins\nand parts for <code>#debian.ch</code> on top of the normal\nactivity.</p>\n<p>The only shortcoming is that the window list takes window names,\nand those need not be unique: if you are joined to\n<code>#debian-devel</code> on multiple networks, I don’t know what\nwill happen. I also did not find a trivial way to fix this.</p>\n<h1 id=\"quick_modifications_to_the_filter_list\">Quick modifications to the filter list</h1>\n<p>The last change I made is a gross hack abusing the <a href=\"http://scripts.irssi.org/html/hide.pl.html\">hide</a> script, so\nthat I can quickly show and hide activity for certain channels.</p>\n<pre><code>settings = {\n  […]\n  \"perl/core/scripts\" = {\n    […]\n    showc = \"eval set activity_hide_targets $chanact_filter_windowlist; hide target add $0; eval eval set chanact_filter_windowlist \\\\$activity_hide_targets; set -default activity_hide_targets\";\n    hidec = \"eval set activity_hide_targets $chanact_filter_windowlist; hide target remove $0; eval eval set chanact_filter_windowlist \\\\$activity_hide_targets; set -default activity_hide_targets\";\n    viewc = \"set chanact_filter_windowlist\";\n  };\n};\n</code>\n</pre>\n<p>The problem is that <code>/hide</code> adds to hide and removes\nto show, which is exactly the inverse of how the window list works.\nThus, the above hack needs to reverse that, and abuses the (no\nlonger necessary) <code>activity_hide_targets</code> setting for\nthat.</p>\n<p>I told you it was gross!</p> ") (pubDate nil "Mon, 10 Aug 2009 20:03:33 +0000"))) ("John Goerzen: Mailing List Hosting" "<p>I’ve hosted email lists of one sort or another probably all the way back to 1995, when I first bought complete.org as an email-only domain fed off a UUCP connection on a long-distance dialup link.</p>\n<p>I’ve only used two mailing list hosting programs in that whole time: Majordomo and Ecartis (used to be known as Listar).

However, <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/\">Debian</a> are trying to sort out a k<a href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/\">FreeBSD</a> kernel based version of their OS, and lots of security-conscious people use <a href=\"http://www.openbsd.org/\">OpenBSD</a> , so, yesterday, I set about trying to get the Entropy Key software working on the BSDs.  I had written a userland <span class=\"caps\">USB</span> daemon for the Entropy Key on Wednesday, using <a href=\"http://libusb.sourceforge.net/\">libusb</a> and since libusb supports FreeBSD, I settled down with a VM of FreeBSD and tried to get an Entropy Key to play ball.</p>\n<p>Building on the efforts of my colleague, having made the software compile (which revealed many glibc/linux-specific issues which were fun to fix, and then various Debian/RedHat specific bits of Lua packaging which I had to fix) and then made it run (which required further fettling of the ports of lua-posix on FreeBSD) I finally had an <tt>ekeyd</tt> which would start in <tt><span class=\"caps\">EGD</span></tt> mode at least.  The FreeBSD port of <a href=\"http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~diego/professional/luasocket/\">luasocket</a> doesn’t enable <span class=\"caps\">UNIX</span> domain sockets, so I added support to <tt>ekeyd</tt> to notice if unix domain sockets weren’t compiled into luasocket and just ignore them, requiring <span class=\"caps\">TCP</span> control and <span class=\"caps\">EGD</span> sockets.</p>\n<p>Finally, after a lot of swearing and poking at things some more, I did manage to get an Entropy Key plugged into the VM and with <tt>ekey-ulusbd</tt> talking to the key, and <tt>ekeyd</tt> talking to that, I had it gathering entropy quite happily.  Indeed once I had ironed out all of the niggles, it worked quite well.  So we’ll be shipping with instructions for building on FreeBSD at least.</p>\n<p>Then I moved on to OpenBSD.  At first glance I was excited that OpenBSD seemed to be better packaged.

However, <a href=\"http://www.debian.org/\">Debian</a> are trying to sort out a k<a href=\"http://www.freebsd.org/\">FreeBSD</a> kernel based version of their OS, and lots of security-conscious people use <a href=\"http://www.openbsd.org/\">OpenBSD</a> , so, yesterday, I set about trying to get the Entropy Key software working on the BSDs.  I had written a userland <span class=\"caps\">USB</span> daemon for the Entropy Key on Wednesday, using <a href=\"http://libusb.sourceforge.net/\">libusb</a> and since libusb supports FreeBSD, I settled down with a VM of FreeBSD and tried to get an Entropy Key to play ball.</p>\n\n<p>Building on the efforts of my colleague, having made the software compile (which revealed many glibc/linux-specific issues which were fun to fix, and then various Debian/RedHat specific bits of Lua packaging which I had to fix) and then made it run (which required further fettling of the ports of lua-posix on FreeBSD) I finally had an <tt>ekeyd</tt> which would start in <tt><span class=\"caps\">EGD</span></tt> mode at least.  The FreeBSD port of <a href=\"http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/~diego/professional/luasocket/\">luasocket</a> doesn’t enable <span class=\"caps\">UNIX</span> domain sockets, so I added support to <tt>ekeyd</tt> to notice if unix domain sockets weren’t compiled into luasocket and just ignore them, requiring <span class=\"caps\">TCP</span> control and <span class=\"caps\">EGD</span> sockets.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, after a lot of swearing and poking at things some more, I did manage to get an Entropy Key plugged into the VM and with <tt>ekey-ulusbd</tt> talking to the key, and <tt>ekeyd</tt> talking to that, I had it gathering entropy quite happily.  Indeed once I had ironed out all of the niggles, it worked quite well.  So we’ll be shipping with instructions for building on FreeBSD at least.</p>\n\n<p>Then I moved on to OpenBSD.  At first glance I was excited that OpenBSD seemed to be better packaged.  Indeed, the OpenBSD packages for Lua, luaposix and luasocket appeared to be much better done, indeed I didn’t need to fettle the luaposix package so it’d load properly, and the luasocket package appeared to have been built with <span class=\"caps\">UNIX</span> domain socket support.

SGI introduced the Visual Workstation,<br />\nrunning Microsoft Windows NT, and O’Reilly and<br />\nAssociates was pushing the company’s first and only<br />\nshrink-wrap software, a web server for Windows NT.<br />\nThe spring 1998 O’Reilly catalog had all Windows books<br />\non the cover, and all the Unix stuff was in back.<br />\nNetscape was on its way down in flames.</p>\n<p>But all this stuff happened too.<br />\n  http://lwn.net/1999/features/1998timeline/</p>\n<p>Oracle for Linux.  VC investment for Red Hat.<br />\nOpen-source releases for Mozilla, Qt, and IBM Secure<br />\nMailer (now Postfix).  Linus Torvalds on the cover<br />\nof _Forbes_.  It was also the first year that Linux<br />\nkernel developers got full-time jobs doing just<br />\nkernel work.</p>\n<p>So there was all this fascinating news and code for<br />\nrecruiting new hackers at the same time that there<br />\nwas a huge power grab intended to drive hackers out.<br />\nIt was a recipe for a political debate.</p>\n<p>The Stallmanite incarnation of Free Software often<br />\ntalks about recapturing a pre-EULA state of innocence<br />\n– not just the fabled environment of the MIT AI Lab,<br />\nwhere Stallman developed his code-sharing habits,<br />\nbut a lot of early science and business computing.<br />\nCopyleft, a tool for defending Free Software,<br />\nis Stallman’s brainchild.  (I remember seeing<br />\na (Sperry?) ad at the Computer History Museum,<br />\nadvertising a large software sharing community as<br />\na feature of the company’s hardware line.  Need to<br />\nfind this again.)</p>\n<p>Is copyright law a constitutional mandate?  It’s in<br />\nthe section with Letters of Marque and Reprisal, all<br />\nthings that Congress is allowed, but not required,<br />\nto do.  </p>\n<p>Why do free software developers act as their own<br />\nlawyers?  Maybe for the same reason they act as<br />\ntheir own testers, PR people, documenters, sysadmins,<br />\nwhatever.  Developers do their own law the same way<br />\nthey do their own logos.  When you get the processes,<br />\nconnectivity, and tools to increase a development<br />\norganization’s tooth/tail ratio, any necessary<br />\n“tail” (context) tasks get picked up by “tooth”<br />\n(core) people.</p></blockquote>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/Interprete/~4/5U7PlhlagBg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" /> ") (pubDate nil "Fri, 14 Aug 2009 13:05:55 +0000"))) ("Julien Danjou: awesome survey 2009" "<img src=\"http://planet.debian.org/heads/jdanjou.png\" width=\"100\" height=\"84\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" style=\"float: right;\">  <p>I've created a <a href=\"http://www.survs.com/survey?id=8BVEV3FO&amp;channel=BH07CQ040D\">small survey about awesome</a>.
