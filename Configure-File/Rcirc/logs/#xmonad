2008-11-12 09:08 dons             is just generally awesome.
2008-11-12 09:09 sjanssen         gwern: none of things were reasons I had to start xmonad
2008-11-12 09:09 sjanssen         (except for the lack of an existing Haskell WM)
2008-11-12 09:09 dons             tuommmo's rants are mega awesome.
2008-11-12 09:09 gwern            sjanssen: that's my point. if he had some goal in mind, I could understand it. but his statement boils down to 'I want to rewrite ion in haskell, because haskell is cool. I don't want to mess with xmonad or even look at it, for no reason whatsoever. I want this called ion so I can get tuomov's mad wm skillz'. the whole package is incoherent
2008-11-12 09:10 dons             gwern: he's just some werido. it's ok. :)
2008-11-12 09:10 dons             the internet is clogged with weirdos.
2008-11-12 09:10 sjanssen         gwern: xmonad and ion have really fundamentally different designs, I think it would be interesting to see what an ion in Haskell looks like
2008-11-12 09:10 gwern            sjanssen: well, also technically there was a previous haskell wm, but let's not split hairs
2008-11-12 09:10 sjanssen         hacking for hacking's sake is good!
2008-11-12 09:10 gwern            it sounds like he expects tumov to do all the hacking...
2008-11-12 09:11 sjanssen         yeah, that's another thing
2008-11-12 09:11 sjanssen         /action is not a big fan of arm chair hackers
2008-11-12 09:11 gwern            /action is an armchair hacker, but I still do enough to justify my blatherings
2008-11-12 09:12 Nafai            gwern: Heh. :)
2008-11-12 09:12 sjanssen         gwern: you write code, you're off the hook
2008-11-12 09:12 dons             i always find the data structure arguments weird, fwiw.
2008-11-12 09:13 dons             and tuomo really seemed to think there's a lot of large, mutable state -- which i think says more about ion than software engineering of wms
2008-11-12 09:14 gwern            dons: what I find more weird - presumably if his 'lots of state' argument was correct, then xmonad would either be buggy, incapable, or extremely complex and hacky code-wise, but he doesn't show any of the 3. xmonad would seem to be a demonstration that wms don't need much state
2008-11-12 09:14 dons             he didn't seem to understand the design.
2008-11-12 09:14 ivanm            since when did Haskell have a Lua interpreter?
2008-11-12 09:14 sjanssen         dons: I doubt he's looked
2008-11-12 09:14 dons             that all state of interest is encapsulated in a single adaptive data structure
2008-11-12 09:15 dons             its ok, but FUD is dumb.
2008-11-12 09:15 gwern            ivanm: dunno. haskell has interpreters for all sorts of languages, generally incomplete
2008-11-12 09:15 gwern            javascript for example
2008-11-12 09:15 sjanssen         ivanm: there are some lua bindings on hackage
2008-11-12 09:15 gwern            (hm. I may never've finished updating the javascript one and uploading to hackage)

2008-11-12 09:40 gwern            it's on hackage. it's very minimalistic, perhaps somewhere between 0.0 and 0.1 xmonad in capability

2008-11-12 09:43 dons             yeah. well, one thing. a compiler.
2008-11-12 09:44 gwern            wonder whether xmonad-light could do the gnomeconfig stuff

2008-11-17 10:07 uhsf             xcompmgr is so slow and full of glitches
2008-11-17 10:07 fryguy           does virtualbox work correctly with default xmonad resize settings?  I'm not on a machine to try right now, but I'll be messing with it tomorrow and i'm wondering if I'm going to be in for a struggle or not
2008-11-17 10:08 p_l              Why not simply add a "standard" API for passing messages to external apps? This way you could put the compositing part into different application which would centered only on that
2008-11-17 10:08 ivanm            fryguy: well, I use VirtualBox here... haven't tried different layouts, but it does tile full-screen at least
2008-11-17 10:09 fryguy           ivanm: i have the extensions installed in guest OS that allows it to dynamically set resolution as virtualbox is resized, and I'm wondering if this functionality will work with the way xmonad does resizes, or if there is some functionality to force a resize event to occur so that virtualbox will change the resolution of the guest
2008-11-17 10:09 ivanm            my guess is that it will work as expected

2008-11-17 11:38 digit            control anymore, no keyboard comands working etc...  even though mouse overs still work in whatever window u r in, or sometimes others, but u cant really do anything...  that ever happen to ya?

2008-11-17 11:44 ivanm            te: did you configure it properly? IIRC, you have to play with either telling it to read from file X and have xmonad write to file X, or else pipe stuff directly to dzen
2008-11-17 11:45 te               i dont want much, just tags, and perhaps weather,time,date

2008-11-17 14:50 sjanssen         are you using valid codes?
2008-11-17 14:50 te               KMSN is Madison, WI
2008-11-17 14:51 te               I've looked it up at 8 places

2008-11-17 14:53 sjanssen         there might be a bug in xmobar's parser that you're trigerring
2008-11-17 14:54 sjanssen         it used to have a problem with negative temperatures, but that should be fixed
2008-11-17 14:54 te               sjanssen: yeah it's not negative here
2008-11-17 14:54 te               HOWEVER, im looking at the difference
2008-11-17 14:54 te               there are two extra lines in KMSN
2008-11-17 14:55 te               and also, there is a WI in the first line of my KMSN.txt
2008-11-17 14:55 te               I noticed a WI in Weather.hs

2008-11-17 14:56 sjanssen         that's no problem
2008-11-17 14:56 sjanssen         it seems to work okay here, with: Run Weather "KMSN" ["-t","<station>: <tempF>F"] 36000
2008-11-17 14:57 sjanssen         which other monitors are you using?

2008-11-17 14:58 sjanssen         oh, did you remember to change the template string?

2008-11-17 20:03 LoneTech         I guess the issue is there's a focused window per workspace, and you see several workspaces.. (I'm new to this, so not very sure)
2008-11-17 20:03 LoneTech         it seems to use withFocused to do the more opaque window
2008-11-17 20:04 LoneTech         I wonder how the border does it
2008-11-17 20:22 LoneTech         now I have checked the source and am more confused.
2008-11-17 20:26 Feuerbach        LoneTech: why?
2008-11-17 20:26 LoneTech         I don't find where focusedBorderColor does anything, only that it's allocated as a color
2008-11-17 20:27 Mad_Marty        /nick Entroacceptor
2008-11-17 20:27 Feuerbach        ah, you're talking about borders
2008-11-17 20:28 Feuerbach        I was looking at FadeInactive, it should be relatively easy to fix
2008-11-17 20:30 LoneTech         it sits in logHook.. perhaps that's only called for the focused screen?
2008-11-17 20:30 LoneTech         if so, it never looks at another workspace, even though it's visible.. thus no fadeout on second monitor
2008-11-17 20:31 Feuerbach        no, it's just 'visibleWins' which isn't aware of other visible screens
2008-11-17 20:32 LoneTech         "Run a monadic action with the current stack set" (withWindowSet) includes all of them?
2008-11-17 20:33 LoneTech         okay, I'm just confused about basic xmonad structure here. don't mind me.
2008-11-17 20:35 Feuerbach        oh, you're right. It really includes visible screens
2008-11-17 20:35 Feuerbach        W.current s : W.visible s
2008-11-17 20:35 LoneTech         right. I just understood that line now.
2008-11-17 20:41 Feuerbach        well, I see now
2008-11-17 20:41 Feuerbach        the function 'unfocused' doesn't take into account whether it's visible or current screen
2008-11-17 20:42 LoneTech         right
2008-11-17 20:43 Feuerbach        how do you thinks guys, should we just fix that or add another hook with another behaviour?
2008-11-17 20:43 LoneTech         so focus is ignored for every visible in the fadeout part
2008-11-17 20:44 LoneTech         I think this is a bug, but am not sure this is the only possible hook that might be interested in visible but unfocused windows.
2008-11-17 20:45 Feuerbach        I also doubt that someone is interested in focused window on inactive screen
2008-11-17 20:45 LoneTech         so, this code needs to process W.visible s without using unfocused
2008-11-17 20:46 Feuerbach        right
2008-11-17 20:52 LoneTech         is !a some sort of notation for Maybe a? (looking at data Stack definition)
2008-11-17 20:52 Feuerbach        no, !a is strictness annotation
2008-11-17 20:53 Feuerbach        you can find detailed description in haskell wiki
2008-11-17 20:53 Feuerbach        but you can ignore it for now

2008-11-18 12:02 gwern            something could be easy and impossible; if I had an oracle for the halting problem, that'd be easy to solve but of course that's impossible
2008-11-18 12:02 ksf              "easy" in less configuration work, and as in "i don't really know enough about xmonad's core to say for sure that it isn't straigtforward". it's just that from what i know, i wouldn't bet on it.
2008-11-18 12:05 ksf              you might be able to fool xmodad into thinking that your one screen is four xinerama screens, though, then the rest is just keeping the default behaviour.

2008-11-18 12:09 hml              nice, layoutscreens  looks good
2008-11-18 12:09 ksf              it usually turns out to be that way.
2008-11-18 12:09 hml              is there somemthing like twopane, but the split is horizontal rather than vertical?
2008-11-18 12:10 sjanssen         use Mirror
2008-11-18 12:10 ksf              all i got to write was a lousy second version of the invisibility hook, and that one was even less complex than the original.

2008-11-18 12:12 sjanssen         you want to mirror the interior layout, not the whole thing
2008-11-18 12:12 hml              actually taht's what I really want
2008-11-18 12:12 ksf              you can hook layouts into keybindings?
2008-11-18 12:12 hml              sjanssen: can you paste me some code?

2008-11-18 12:18 b4taylor         Awesome, TwoPane looks like my grid replacement.
2008-11-18 12:20 hml              when using layoutscreens, how does switching workspaces work?
2008-11-18 12:20 hml              hitting  alt-1234
2008-11-18 12:20 hml              i can't find the pattern of how my workspaces are being moved around
2008-11-18 12:20 b4taylor         Awe damn. This means I need to rebind a key that moves to master.
2008-11-18 12:21 b4taylor         Oh, sweet. mod+return was still bound.
2008-11-18 12:21 ksf              hml, abandon reason and just work instinctively. worked for me.
2008-11-18 12:21 hml              ksf: huh?
2008-11-18 12:22 sjanssen         hml: the default screen bindings probably suck for you, try W.view instead of W.greedyView
2008-11-18 12:22 dmwit            hml: It's very simple.
2008-11-18 12:22 dmwit            hml: Whatever key you hit, the currently focused screen goes to that workspace.
2008-11-18 12:22 dmwit            hml: If that workspace happens to be visible on another screen, well, nuts to that other screen, amirite?
2008-11-18 12:23 hml              dmwit: that makes sense now; thanks! :-)
2008-11-18 12:23 hml                  , ((modMask, xK_x     ), layoutScreens 4 (Tall 2 0.0 0.5))
2008-11-18 12:24 hml              so I have a top left, bot left, top right ...  but now bot right frame
2008-11-18 12:24 ksf              in other words, (greedyView n) . (greedyView n) = id
2008-11-18 12:24 hml              *but no bot right frame*
2008-11-18 12:24 sjanssen         hml: you probably don't have any windows on that workspace
2008-11-18 12:25 ksf              sjanssen, aren't there just three default bindings for screens? mod w, mod e and another one.
2008-11-18 12:26 sjanssen         ksf: yes; w, e, r
2008-11-18 12:26 ksf              so it could prove difficult to switch to the fourth one.
2008-11-18 12:26 sjanssen         yes, definitely :)
2008-11-18 12:26 sjanssen         with the latest darcs you can click on the empty workspace to switch to it
2008-11-18 12:26 hml              sjanssen: wow, this is so weird, is 'it needs a window in that workspace' a coding 'feature' ?
2008-11-18 12:27 sjanssen         hml: what would it display if there is no window there?
2008-11-18 12:27 ksf              hml, what would you want to do with it if it doesn't contain a thing?
2008-11-18 12:27 sjanssen         hml: I'm assuming you have an blank space there, correct?
2008-11-18 12:27 ksf              ('xept creating windows)
2008-11-18 12:28 ksf              you can of course switch to it by switching workspaces around and then focusing a window that's there with the mouse.
2008-11-18 12:29 hml              okay; so I have the following, workspace1=firefox, workspace4=empty; topleft=workspace1, botleft=workspace that is empty; now, I move my mouse cursor into  botleft, then I hit alt-1 ... and the firefox workspace does not move into  that regbion; however I can make it move into workspaces that already contain windows
2008-11-18 12:29 ksf              this is were, as sjanssen pointed out, the latest darcs version differs from the original "let's keep the logic free of anything merely related to the real world"-philosophy.
2008-11-18 12:30 sjanssen         ksf: what are you talking about?
2008-11-18 12:30 ksf              creating windows on empty workspaces.
2008-11-18 12:30 sjanssen         I don't think that is an accurate portrayal of xmonad's philosophy at any point
2008-11-18 12:30 ksf              you can't activate an empty workspace with the mouse in 0.8
2008-11-18 12:31 ksf              it's an accurate description of haskell's philosophy...
2008-11-18 12:31 sjanssen         also not true
2008-11-18 12:31 ksf              ...and code purity tends to spread into the real world, leading to behaviour that could be considered strange for programs.
2008-11-18 12:32 sjanssen         I don't think you understand the real situation
2008-11-18 12:32 ksf              I think I'm merely exaggerating.
2008-11-18 12:33 sjanssen         purity has absolutely nothing to do with our previous handling of screens
2008-11-18 12:34 ksf              well purity leads to certain design decisions and certain design decisions lead to certain behaviour.
2008-11-18 12:35 ksf              it's more the _ideal_ that influences stuff, not the semantics.
2008-11-18 12:35 sjanssen         hml: you'll want to do two things: upgrade to the latest darcs to get click-to-focus screens, and add an additional keybinding for your fourth screen
2008-11-18 12:36 sjanssen         ksf: the screen behavior has nothing to do with the parts of xmonad's design which are influnced by purity
2008-11-18 12:36 sjanssen         it's true, I promise :)
2008-11-18 12:38 ksf              /action considers his argument to be best driven home later, when sjanssen doesn't pay attention.
2008-11-18 12:39 ksf              ...in some different context, too.
2008-11-18 12:39 sjanssen         you might be right if you were talking about some other behavior, but it just doesn't apply to this particular situation
2008-11-18 12:40 ksf              I'm gonna have a look at the code after I've had some sleep.
2008-11-18 12:47 b4taylor         Anyone familiar with GTK terminology?
2008-11-18 12:48 b4taylor         I want to show a list of strings that will look like file browsing. Like in nautilus or thunar.

2008-11-18 13:58 sjanssen         but it is strange, I don't think the actual source package uses the XT parts of X11

2008-11-18 14:08 ManateeLazyCat   b4taylor: Now i have install libxt-dev, and cabal have pass check for X libraries, but download is slow, so i'm wait result cabal.
2008-11-18 14:09 sjanssen         libxt-dev is not actually required to build X11 on Ubuntu 8.10

2008-11-18 14:35 e-Jah            in fact it's working
2008-11-18 14:35 e-Jah            but the effect is not instantaneous
2008-11-18 14:36 e-Jah            sjanssen: after have broadcastMessage I have to move my mouse to get it done
2008-11-18 14:36 e-Jah            is it an issue or I am missing something?
2008-11-18 14:36 e-Jah            My config looks like that:
2008-11-18 14:36 e-Jah            ((mod4Mask .|. shiftMask, xK_f), broadcastMessage (Toggle "Full"))
2008-11-18 14:36 sjanssen         oh, you also need to refresh the screen when using broadcastMessage
2008-11-18 14:38 e-Jah            ha ok :) ho can I modify my settings to accomplish that?
2008-11-18 14:39 sjanssen         stick >> refresh at the end
2008-11-18 14:40 e-Jah            sjanssen: perfect!

2008-11-18 14:41 sjanssen         do we have a disproportionate number of xmonad users on reddit, or are there just tons of xmonad users?
2008-11-18 14:42 sjanssen         it seems like every time the subject of WMs comes up on reddit, I see a comment about xmonad
2008-11-18 14:42 ManateeLazyCat   I have build XMonad use cabal success, but when install XMonad-contrilb use cabal got error "xmonad-contrib-0.8 failed during the building phase", and xmonad-utils have same problem. Any ideas?
2008-11-18 14:43 sjanssen         ManateeLazyCat: contrib might not be 6.10 compatible yet
2008-11-18 14:43 e-Jah            one more question, I love the functionality Mod-Enter to switch the focus window to master pane, but is it possible to have the reverse effect once we do the shortcut again?
2008-11-18 14:44 ManateeLazyCat   sjanssen: Oh, too bad.
2008-11-18 14:44 sjanssen         e-Jah: not really
2008-11-18 14:44 ManateeLazyCat   sjanssen: Are you use XMonad with 6.10? Stable? Buggy?
2008-11-18 14:45 e-Jah            ok, anyway I guess with the Togglt shortcut it's enough. I often swith some window to the master pane just for a quick look, so it would have be nice to be able to switch back
2008-11-18 14:46 e-Jah            but as now I can put the window in full screen in just one shortcut, should be enough
2008-11-18 14:46 sjanssen         ManateeLazyCat: I'm on 6.8

2008-11-18 14:48 ManateeLazyCat   sjanssen: I want to ask a question, how to uninstall xmonad use cabal?
2008-11-18 14:49 sjanssen         ManateeLazyCat: cabal doesn't support uninstall
2008-11-18 14:50 sjanssen         you can "ghc-pkg unregister xmonad" to make GHC forget about the xmonad package, but it won't delete the files
2008-11-18 14:50 mephx            /quit Read error: 113 (No route to host)
2008-11-18 14:51 ManateeLazyCat   sjanssen: This way is safe? Delete xmonad file or directory in "~/.cabal/packages/hackage.haskell.org/" and use "ghc-pkg unregister xmonad".
2008-11-18 14:54 sjanssen         ManateeLazyCat: that still leaves files behind
2008-11-18 14:54 ManateeLazyCat   sjanssen: Delete correspond files in "~/.cabal/" and use "ghc-pkg unregister PackageName" equal uninstall?
2008-11-18 14:54 sjanssen         ManateeLazyCat: there are more files than the ones in /packages
2008-11-18 14:55 sjanssen         ManateeLazyCat: there will also be files in .cabal/lib
2008-11-18 14:55 ManateeLazyCat   sjanssen: So delete all files or directory in "~/.cabal", it's okay?
2008-11-18 14:55 sjanssen         ManateeLazyCat: you don't want to do that, that will delete way more than just xmonad
2008-11-18 14:56 ManateeLazyCat   sjanssen: How to do?
2008-11-18 14:57 ManateeLazyCat   sjanssen: Strange, why cabal not support uninstall?
2008-11-18 14:57 sjanssen         reading the awesome bug tracker is interesting, seeing some issues that we've encountered in the past http://awesome.naquadah.org/bugs/index.php?do=details&task_id=334 (easy fix)

2008-11-18 15:03 ManateeLazyCat   sjanssen: Are you use gtk2hs, can compatible with 6.10?

2008-11-18 15:04 ManateeLazyCat   sjanssen: http://www.haskell.org/gtk2hs/. I think it's okay if i use darcs version.

2008-11-18 15:15 sjanssen         ManateeLazyCat: xmonad-utils is not required, by the way

2008-11-18 15:35 dmwit_           "skull", "cull", "mull" all seem to fit if not.
2008-11-18 15:40 twifkak          hrm. indeed.
2008-11-18 15:40 twifkak          though using them in the "deemphasized" tone is a little difficult.
2008-11-18 15:40 dmwit_           right
2008-11-18 15:40 twifkak          the rhyming dictionary only turned up rascal. boo rhyming dictionary.
2008-11-18 15:53 sjanssen         I wonder if it better to unmap old windows before mapping windows or vice versa ...
2008-11-18 15:53 twifkak          example?
2008-11-18 15:54 sjanssen         in XMonad.Operations.windows we do the latter
2008-11-18 15:54 sjanssen         we map all windows that should be visible, then we unmap all windows that should not be visible
2008-11-18 15:54 twifkak          causing potential double paint?
2008-11-18 15:55 sjanssen         possibly
2008-11-18 15:55 sjanssen         though the visible windows may be higher in the stacking order
2008-11-18 15:56 twifkak          may, and probably are. hrm, i wonder if that has to do with this pixel motion.
2008-11-18 15:56 sjanssen         pixel motion?
2008-11-18 15:56 twifkak          when i move from urxvt to firefox (both unbordered), the urxvt content shifts down and right a pixel before being painted over
2008-11-18 15:56 sjanssen         I'm testing, and the one problem is that you see a flicker of the root window when changing workspaces
2008-11-18 15:57 sjanssen         twifkak: nah, that's unrelated
2008-11-18 15:57 twifkak          ohk
2008-11-18 15:57 sjanssen         smartBorders removes the border before xmonad has a chance to unmap
2008-11-18 15:57 twifkak          okay
2008-11-18 15:57 twifkak          well, root flicker bad
2008-11-18 15:58 sjanssen         it is a bit annoying
2008-11-18 15:58 twifkak          i switch workspaces relentlessly sometimes, and it would be quite annoying.
2008-11-18 15:59 sjanssen         you'll always see some flicker, it's just whether the flicker involves the root window or the contents of your old windows
2008-11-18 16:00 sjanssen         the contents of old windows look similar to the contents of the new windows, so you might not notice as much
2008-11-18 16:00 twifkak          i don't see any flicker now.
2008-11-18 16:01 twifkak          new windows get mapped. if above, then painting, and then old unmapping causes no repainting. if below, then no painting until old unmapped. right?
2008-11-18 16:01 sjanssen         you'd probably notice when switching between workspaces of different colors
2008-11-18 16:02 sjanssen         twifkak: well, you get a mix of the two when some windows are higher and some are lower
2008-11-18 16:02 twifkak          well, i'm giving myself a headache tryring to reproduce (just opened a bright red term to switch to) - perhaps it's faster than my monitor's refresh?
2008-11-18 16:02 sjanssen         I don't notice the flicker at all when my background is plain white, but that hardly helps :)
2008-11-18 16:03 sjanssen         you might actually see no flicker if the newly mapped windows are higher in the stacking order
2008-11-18 16:03 twifkak          what's wrong with my logic above? seems to me no flicker. just maybe not all windows painted at the same time.
2008-11-18 16:04 sjanssen         the logic is okay
2008-11-18 16:05 sjanssen         I worry about cases where half the window is exposed, but the other half is obscured
2008-11-18 16:06 twifkak          okay.
2008-11-18 16:06 sjanssen         and I think there might be some performance gain when mapping applications and exposing them simultaneously
2008-11-18 16:06 twifkak          ooh, benchmark it! :)
2008-11-18 16:06 sjanssen         actually, if they're below there will be two paints
2008-11-18 16:06 twifkak          okay, i have to sleep. presentation tomorrow.
2008-11-18 16:06 sjanssen         because windows only receive expose events, never obscure events

2008-11-22 18:53 SparFux          Hi! I want to use window transparency, but xcompmgr give a lot of errors like: "error 177 request 154 minor 8 serial 16570" with the last number counting up. What can I do?
2008-11-22 18:56 sjanssen         SparFux: sounds like your server/driver doesn't have support for the necessary extensions?
2008-11-22 18:57 SparFux          I have composite enabled.
2008-11-22 18:57 SparFux          xdpyinfo | grep Composite returns Composite.
2008-11-22 18:58 SparFux          That's the extension I need.
2008-11-22 19:00 sjanssen         I dunno
2008-11-22 19:00 sjanssen         all I can say is "works for me"
2008-11-22 19:01 SparFux          perhaps I need  xcompmgr DAMAGE and XFIXES extensions too.
2008-11-22 19:01 SparFux          what graphics card do you use?
2008-11-22 19:01 sjanssen         some old nvidia card
2008-11-22 19:01 SparFux          hm...

2008-11-22 19:01 SparFux          you use xcompmgr?
2008-11-22 19:02 sjanssen         not usually, but it does work
2008-11-22 19:02 SparFux          what extensions do you have installed? xdpyinfo output?
2008-11-22 19:03 SparFux          do you see the background image behind transparent windows?
2008-11-22 19:03 sjanssen         I have too many extensions to list
2008-11-22 19:04 sjanssen         xcompmgr's man page says that XFIXES, DAMAGE and COMPOSITE are required.  Do you have all of those?

2008-11-22 19:14 sjanssen         I have RENDER in my list of extensions
2008-11-22 19:14 SparFux          I see.
2008-11-22 19:15 SparFux          The bug is listed in debian bug reports for xcompmgr! :-)
2008-11-22 19:15 SparFux          But no solution.
2008-11-22 19:15 SparFux          It might really be there is some dependency missing.
2008-11-22 19:16 SparFux          But I cannot find any homepage telling me what compile requirements of anything xcompmgr needs.
2008-11-22 19:18 Entroacceptor    not much
2008-11-22 19:18 SparFux          It would look really nice with transparency.

2008-11-24 10:30 sjanssen         gwern: did this haddock section thing work in previous versions?
2008-11-24 10:31 gwern            sjanssen: I have no idea. we'd have to ask someone with 0.8 to try I guess
2008-11-24 10:31 gwern            (since I don't think anything earlier would work with xmc)
2008-11-24 10:31 sjanssen         I would imagine it must have worked -- why else would they be there in the first place?
2008-11-24 10:31 gwern            *haddock 0.8
2008-11-24 10:31 sjanssen         gwern: for now, I think the resolution should be to remove the section links
2008-11-24 10:31 sjanssen         I'm a bit tired of hearing about the broken links
2008-11-24 10:31 gwern            sjanssen: perhaps people simply borrowed it from mediawiki markup
2008-11-24 10:32 gwern            where [[foo#bar]] does in fact take you to section bar in article foo
2008-11-24 10:32 sjanssen         possible
2008-11-24 10:32 sjanssen         actually, shouldn't these docs be wiki pages anyway?
2008-11-24 10:33 gwern            the specific 'Extending' module you mean?
2008-11-24 10:33 sjanssen         all of XMonad.Doc*
2008-11-24 10:33 sjanssen         what is the advantage to having these in source code?
2008-11-24 10:33 gwern            I think we discussed keeping the docs out of the repo, yes, but we decided that then they wouldn't be obviously available to darcs users
2008-11-24 10:33 gwern            nor would they get packaged up
2008-11-24 10:33 gwern            and they would get out of sync
2008-11-24 10:34 sjanssen         it is true that they wouldn't be packaged, but I don't think the out of sync thing applies
2008-11-24 10:34 gwern            /action is merely summarizing what I remember from the discussions here back around 0.2 or something like that
2008-11-24 10:35 sjanssen         gwern: if you look at the doc modules, there isn't any actual code in them, nothing to guarantee that the prose is in sync with the code
2008-11-24 10:35 sjanssen         we could also mirror the wiki's text in the repo, so all source users have a copy to reference
2008-11-24 10:36 gwern            how would we sync wiki and darcs versions?
2008-11-24 10:37 chandler1        sjanssen: didn't you work on xmobar?
2008-11-24 10:37 sjanssen         I guess one advantage to the docs is that it is easy to link to modules
2008-11-24 10:37 sjanssen         chandler1: yes, I work on it occasionally
2008-11-24 10:37 chandler1        sjanssen: i have two bugs, one more important than the other
2008-11-24 10:37 abbe             /join 
2008-11-24 10:37 chandler1        one, it doesn't work with ghc 6.10
2008-11-24 10:37 chandler1        two, it has a memory leak, the strings displayed aren't getting GC'ed correctly
2008-11-24 10:38 sjanssen         gwern: require that all edits happen on the wiki, and periodically (every release or so) update the copy in darcs
2008-11-24 10:38 chandler1        (easy to repro that one, just scroll threw diff window titles fast, watch the memory footprint grow)
2008-11-24 10:38 sjanssen         chandler1: I don't use GHC 6.10, so I can't help with the first issue
2008-11-24 10:38 chandler1        damn
2008-11-24 10:38 chandler1        that's the one that won't even let me install it
2008-11-24 10:38 sjanssen         chandler1: also, "doesn't work" isn't helpful at all
2008-11-24 10:39 chandler1        i can paste the error, but i doubt it'll help
2008-11-24 10:39 chandler1        ok, fair enough
2008-11-24 10:39 chandler1        lame bug report on my part
2008-11-24 10:39 sjanssen         chandler1: ah, compile error?  Feel free to paste it, we might be able to figure it out
2008-11-24 10:39 sjanssen         I was expecting some sort of run time error which is more difficult
2008-11-24 10:39 gwern            sjanssen: sounds kind of icky
2008-11-24 10:40 chandler1        sjanssen: here:
2008-11-24 10:40 chandler1        Plugins/StdinReader.hs:29:15:
2008-11-24 10:40 chandler1            Ambiguous type variable `e' in the constraint:
2008-11-24 10:40 chandler1              `GHC.Exception.Exception e'
2008-11-24 10:40 chandler1                arising from a use of `catch' at Plugins/StdinReader.hs:29:15-78
2008-11-24 10:40 chandler1            Probable fix: add a type signature that fixes these type variable(s)
2008-11-24 10:40 chandler1        this is out of darcs btw, not the release
2008-11-24 10:40 sjanssen         chandler1: re: the second issue, are you absolutely certain xmobar is actually leaking memory, or is it just small growth due to garbage collection?
2008-11-24 10:40 dmwit__          /join 
2008-11-24 10:40 chandler1        sjanssen: i can get its resident memory to be 60mb
2008-11-24 10:41 chandler1        once it was 80mb
2008-11-24 10:41 chandler1        seems a bit much for xmobar. ;]
2008-11-24 10:41 sjanssen         ah, I've never seen that
2008-11-24 10:41 sjanssen         do you use xft?
2008-11-24 10:41 chandler1        yes
2008-11-24 10:41 chandler1        (i think)
2008-11-24 10:41 sjanssen         well, what does your font string look like?
2008-11-24 10:41 chandler1        as soon as i get it installed, i'll repro, and make sure its not just the version i have installed on the other machine
2008-11-24 10:42 chandler1        ^^, haven't repro'ed on this machine yet... hmm, but i do have access to one with it.
2008-11-24 10:42 chandler1        "xft:Monospace-9"
2008-11-24 10:42 sjanssen         chandler1: yeah, xft fonts might leak
2008-11-24 10:43 sjanssen         I use a core font, and it doesn't leak
2008-11-24 10:43 chandler1        interesting
2008-11-24 10:43 chandler1        is it actually an X issue?
2008-11-24 10:43 sjanssen         nah, probably an xmobar problem
2008-11-24 10:43 chandler1        mk
2008-11-24 10:43 sjanssen         one that only manifests in the xft code path
2008-11-24 10:43 chandler1        lemme know if i can help diagnose in any way
2008-11-24 10:43 chandler1        (once its installed that is)
2008-11-24 10:44 sjanssen         chandler1: it would be helpful to make sure it is an xft thing -- reproduce the bug with xft on, and determine that it doesn't appear without xft
2008-11-24 10:44 sjanssen         /action kind of dislikes GHC's new exception mechanism
2008-11-24 10:44 sjanssen         "catch (hGetLineSafe stdin) (\e -> do hPrint stderr e; return "")" should that code really be illegal?
2008-11-24 10:45 sjanssen         chandler1: the GHC 6.10 issue should be fixed in darcs now

2008-11-24 13:36 pen              get it...where?
2008-11-24 13:37 Debugger         google: x11 xft

2008-11-24 13:37 shepheb          direct from hackage, probably
2008-11-24 13:38 pen              should I get 0.3? or just for safe 0.2?
2008-11-24 13:38 shepheb          newest versions
2008-11-24 13:38 pen              0.3?
2008-11-24 13:39 pen              but I think I see 0.4?
2008-11-24 13:40 shepheb          0.3 is good
2008-11-24 13:40 pen              ok
2008-11-24 13:40 pen              how to install it?
2008-11-24 13:40 pen              there is no makefile
2008-11-24 13:40 shepheb          no. the standard Cabal dance is thus:
2008-11-24 13:40 shepheb          runghc Setup configure --user --prefix=$HOME
2008-11-24 13:41 shepheb          runghc Setup build
2008-11-24 13:41 shepheb          runghc Setup install
2008-11-24 13:41 pen              so prefix is home for the most part?
2008-11-24 13:41 shepheb          generally, yes
2008-11-24 13:41 pen              ok I will try that
2008-11-24 13:43 pen              it says it cannot found pkg-config package xft
2008-11-24 13:43 pen              ??
2008-11-24 13:44 Debugger         Install the xft development package from debian..
2008-11-24 13:44 pen              you mean by libxft2-dev?
2008-11-24 13:44 Debugger         Probably
2008-11-24 13:44 pen              or libxft-dev?
2008-11-24 13:45 Debugger         No idea :/
2008-11-24 13:45 pen              maybe I will just install 2
2008-11-24 13:47 pen              it works
2008-11-24 13:48 pen              weird
2008-11-24 13:49 pen              after I install xft 0.3
2008-11-24 13:49 pen              it still says X11-xft is missing

2008-11-27 11:56 te               nevermind, i used cabal install and it worked
2008-11-27 11:56 te               compiling from source wasn't liking me

2008-11-27 11:59 shepheb          but that's academic, you've solved the issue
2008-11-27 11:59 legis            I don't know what I press sometimes in some workspaces that I can't switch between apps with mod-j

2008-11-27 12:00 shepheb          odd
2008-11-27 12:01 shepheb          is there any pattern to the apps on that workspace?
2008-11-27 12:01 legis            no
2008-11-27 12:02 legis            If I move those two apps for example to another workspace the same happens.
2008-11-27 12:03 shepheb          no, I mean does it always happen to particular apps
2008-11-27 12:03 legis            I have to put them each one in a different workspace to be able to switch between.

2008-11-27 12:25 shepheb          te: are you importing System.IO.UTF8 in your xmonad.hs?
2008-11-27 12:25 te               ah-ha!
2008-11-27 12:25 te               you rule
2008-11-27 12:26 te               does hPutStrLn change if i add UTF8 support, and should I have System.IO in there as well shepheb
2008-11-27 12:26 te               or should i swap them
2008-11-27 12:26 te               omg yes, booya
2008-11-27 12:26 te               fixed
2008-11-27 12:29 shepheb          te: it shouldn't matter, there's some C preprocessor magic or something to make the UTF8 versions override the default versions
2008-11-27 12:29 te               i actually had to remove System.IO
2008-11-27 12:29 te               and just use IO.UTF8, in order for it to work
2008-11-27 12:29 te               it yelled at me for using hPutStrLn
2008-11-27 12:29 shepheb          ah, okay
2008-11-27 12:30 shepheb          ah, because it was ambiguous
2008-11-27 12:30 te               /action is learning Haskell totally unintentionally
2008-11-27 12:32 shepheb          te: xmonad is a leading Haskell gateway drug

2008-11-27 12:32 te               it's like learning C,  but more fun
2008-11-27 12:32 te               is xmonad.org down?
2008-11-27 12:33 shepheb          te: it is for me
2008-11-27 12:33 te               just checking
2008-11-27 12:38 te               shepheb: maybe you could counsel me while there is no access to docs
2008-11-27 12:38 shepheb          te: sure, what do you need?
2008-11-27 12:40 te               I'm trying to figure out how to explain this
2008-11-27 12:40 te               basically I grabbed an extension to let me search google with my browser by using a hotkey
2008-11-27 12:40 Paul-S           /quit "Lost terminal"
2008-11-27 12:40 te               I wanted to change the location and colors of the prompt that comes up
2008-11-27 12:40 gwern            easy enough
2008-11-27 12:41 te               so I assumed I needed to change the default XPConfig
2008-11-27 12:41 gwern            indeed
2008-11-27 12:41 te               I've done that, but I'm not seeing any changes
2008-11-27 12:41 gwern            promptSearch newXP google, eg
2008-11-27 12:41 gwern            sure you actually reloaded or made use of the newXP?
2008-11-27 12:41 te               not sure i made use of the newXP
2008-11-27 12:42 te               first off im doing this:
2008-11-27 12:42 te               import XMonad.Prompt (XPPosition(Bottom), XPConfig(historySize, height, position, promptBorderWidth, fgColor, bgColor, font, fgHLight, bgHLight, borderColor), defaultXPConfig)
2008-11-27 12:43 te               I use this in `additionalKeys`
2008-11-27 12:43 te                       ((mod1Mask, xK_s), SM.submap $ searchEngineMap $ S.promptSearch P.defaultXPConfig)
2008-11-27 12:43 te               changing defaultXPConfig to P.myXPConfig breaks it
2008-11-27 12:43 gwern            /action sees the problem...
2008-11-27 12:43 te               oh goodie
2008-11-27 12:43 gwern            yes, P.myXPConfig can't possibly be right
2008-11-27 12:43 shepheb          /action apologizes for vanishing, but gwern's got it covered
2008-11-27 12:44 te               no prob shepheb i appreciate all of the help everyone
2008-11-27 12:44 gwern            incidentally, are you sure you aren't doing import qualified XMonad.Prompt as P?
2008-11-27 12:44 te               ah-ha, yes I am
2008-11-27 12:44 gwern            otherwise I can't see why you're doing P.defaultXPConfig
2008-11-27 12:44 te               I didn't even see that little bugger
2008-11-27 12:44 te               I added it as part of the use-case
2008-11-27 12:45 gwern            te: yes, well anyway, one would typically do something like 'myXPConfig = defaultXPConfig { borderColor = "green" etc. }' and then bind 'promptSearch myXPConfig google'
2008-11-27 12:46 gwern            P.myXPconfig is quite impossible - what you are saying is that the module denoted by P, Prompt, exports a function by the name of myXPConfig - which it obviously doesn't, Prompt only has defaultXPConfig
2008-11-27 12:46 te               im following you
2008-11-27 12:47 te               i cant overwrite defaultXPConfig because of how Haskell operates, right?  non-destructive and all that..
2008-11-27 12:48 gwern            yes. you are creating a new value by the name of myXPConfig
2008-11-27 12:48 gwern            defaultXPConfig is exactly the same as it ever was
2008-11-27 12:48 te               so, how can i get myXPConfig to fit in there, i wonder
2008-11-27 12:48 gwern            you are copying defaultXPConfig, but only partially
2008-11-27 12:48 gwern            I've already said how
2008-11-27 12:49 te               you explained the typical way of doing it, i was just trying to figure out how to fit it into the subMap + promptSearch
2008-11-27 12:49 te               it seems like there's got to be a way to do that
2008-11-27 12:50 b4taylor         shepheb: submap totally works on my power button.
2008-11-27 12:50 gwern            hm. I probably should look at promptSearch. I didn't write that one
2008-11-27 12:50 b4taylor         It was awesome.
2008-11-27 12:50 te               gwern: I understand what you're saying and thank you
2008-11-27 12:50 b4taylor         err, to be more precise, as the sol'n to my power button thing.
2008-11-27 12:50 te               gwern: I'm just trying to get fancy and get this to work
2008-11-27 12:50 shepheb          b4taylor: so what, you have xmonad bound to <powerkey> {s,h}?
2008-11-27 12:51 b4taylor         powerkey powerkey for shutdown
2008-11-27 12:51 gwern            wait, promptSearch's first argument is an XPCOnfig... what's the problem?
2008-11-27 12:51 b4taylor         powerkey mediakey for hibernate.
2008-11-27 12:52 te               gwern: I---I don't know..
2008-11-27 12:52 te               heh
2008-11-27 12:53 shepheb          b4taylor: sweet
2008-11-27 12:54 shepheb          I'll probably just walk my Eee around powered up, it's solid state so it's safe enough to move around with
2008-11-27 12:55 te               gwern: it says myXPConfig is not in scope
2008-11-27 12:56 gwern            sounds like you didn't define it
2008-11-27 12:56 te               myXPConfig = defaultXPConfig
2008-11-27 12:57 te               { font = ... }
2008-11-27 12:57 te               is that no sufficient?
2008-11-27 12:57 te               not*
2008-11-27 12:57 gwern            te: maybe you could just hpaste your entire config

2008-11-27 12:59 gwern            and so we loop back to the beginning of the discussion...
2008-11-27 12:59 te               if i use P.myXPConfig, it says it's out of scope
2008-11-27 12:59 gwern            replace P.defaultXPConfig with myXPConfig
2008-11-27 12:59 gwern            no P.
2008-11-27 12:59 gwern            I Explained Why That Would Not Work
2008-11-27 13:01 te               gwern: I was confused because you made it sound like Prompt would accept an XPConfig
2008-11-27 13:01 te               im not understanding the difference between the P.myXPConfig, versus just myXPConfig
2008-11-27 13:01 gwern            well, you really shouldn't've imported qualified, that's just confusing you
2008-11-27 13:02 te               so promptSearch will accept an XPConfig as an argument
2008-11-27 13:02 te               but in order to access defaultXPConfig, it needs the P
2008-11-27 13:02 te               because defaultXPConfig lives in Prompt
2008-11-27 13:02 gwern            P.myXPConfig tells the haskell language/compiler that it *MUST* find a function in the module P with the *exact* name myXPConfig. there could be a billion myXPConfigs defined in the actual file, but the haskell compiler/language is never ever ever allowed to use the local myXPConfig
2008-11-27 13:03 gwern            te: see, that's why I said the qualified thing was a mistake to do
2008-11-27 13:03 te               ah-ha, hence the error with scope
2008-11-27 13:03 te               it's not even looking locally
2008-11-27 13:04 te               gwern: thank you, oh wise one

2008-11-29 23:12 mikeX            so, here's the scenario, the same monitor has been tested on a different setup, a pc I had borrowed to her, which run a similar setup, debian testing with xmonad 0.8, and an even slower nvidia card, an onboard 6150E, and it worked _fine_

2008-12-03 09:25 gwern            no. I meant darcs xmonad; if you are on x86_64 and experience the prompt bug that'd be valuable to know for the bug report
2008-12-03 09:25 gwern            we don't know for sure it's architecture related
