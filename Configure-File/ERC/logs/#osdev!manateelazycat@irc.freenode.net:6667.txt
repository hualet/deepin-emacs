<TkTech> I only promote it because its very simple to port to your own OS
                                                                     [03:41:07]

<geist> 16bit protected mode is a valid mode, just not used by anyone
                                                                     [03:44:39]
<geist> it's even more rare than most of the other stuff that's rare on x86
                                                                     [03:44:49]
<Kenaj_> i will, haha
<Kenaj_> 32 bit is scary  [03:44:56]
<geist> it's essentially '286 mode'  [03:45:02]
<Kenaj_> so much complicated  [03:45:07]
<geist> uh. okay  [03:45:14]
<geist> seems like 16 bit protected would be far worse  [03:45:24]
<Kenaj_> half as scary HEHE  [03:45:36]
<geist> you have all the complexity of32bit protected mode with the additional
        headache of having to deal with a smaller address space  [03:45:40]
<geist> which means you will never find a compiler that can use it, etc
                                                                     [03:45:53]
<geist> and you'll have to do all the size prefix overrides  [03:46:03]
<Kenaj_> fasm can?  [03:46:05]
<geist> well, gee if you're just going to write assembly i guess  [03:46:25]
<geist> but you're also bitching about how complicated stuff is  [03:46:32]
<Kenaj_> haha  [03:46:39]
<geist> seems a little counter intuitive  [03:46:40]
<Kenaj_> yes, assembler OS  [03:46:42]
<Kenaj_> first one ever!  [03:46:47]
<geist> *shrug* suit yourself  [03:46:48]
<Kenaj_> cool project  [03:46:49]
<geist> no, not by a long shot  [03:46:54]
<Kenaj_> no`? name one!  [03:47:03]
<geist> menuetos is the first one that comes to mind  [03:47:22]
<Kenaj_> neither linux or windows use much assembler. i mean everyhing in as
                                                                     [03:47:27]
<geist> and essentially everything written before 1970  [03:47:29]
<geist> and a lot of stuff afterwards  [03:47:36]
<geist> lots of L4 implementations are almost pure assembly  [03:47:42]
<geist> etc  [03:47:45]
<geist> and lots of stuff written on microcontrollers  [03:48:16]
<TkTech> geist: I commend your patience  [03:48:53]
<geist> i'm a patient person today  [03:49:15]
<geist> i'm even (gasp) going over my JIRA bugs today and cleaning them up
                                                                     [03:49:32]
<TkTech> o: What do you use JIRA for?  [03:49:44]
<Kenaj_> i lost my internet connections  [03:49:45]
<TkTech> Personal license version?  [03:49:51]
<Kenaj_> what was it?
<geist> it's our bug tracking system  [03:49:52]
<geist> no, work  [03:49:55]
<TkTech> I know what it is, I use it all the time  [03:49:59]
<Kenaj_> menuetos is all assembler
         :-((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((
                                                                     [03:50:14]
<TkTech> Where do you work?  [03:50:17]
<Kenaj_> my life project is ruined  [03:50:18]
<Kenaj_> what to do now?  [03:50:24]
<geist> Kenaj_: here's the rest of what i said after you left  [03:50:27]
<Kenaj_> in machine code  [03:50:30]
<Kenaj_> haha  [03:50:33]
<geist> 11:47 < geist> and essentially everything written before 1970
                                                                     [03:50:36]
<geist> 11:47 < geist> and a lot of stuff afterwards
<geist> 11:47 < geist> lots of L4 implementations are almost pure assembly
<geist> 11:47 < geist> etc
<geist> 11:48 < geist> and lots of stuff written on microcontrollers
<Kenaj_> arg  [03:50:47]
<Kenaj_> ok  [03:50:49]
<geist> look, if 32bit is too complicated, you probably have no business
        trying to write an os in assembly  [03:51:08]
<geist> i'd do it only if you're already an expert  [03:51:17]
<geist> TkTech: Palm  [03:51:24]
<TkTech> Oh!  [03:51:28]
<TkTech> Oh god, I forgot the entire conversation we had.  [03:51:36]
<TkTech> I need sleep ;(  [03:51:44]
<geist> but my last company used it too  [03:51:45]
<Kenaj_> ok, i kill my self now  [03:51:47]
<geist> and they were quite a bit smaller  [03:51:48]
<geist> that had better not be gr00ber  [03:52:00]
<TkTech> nubCounterm;  [03:52:06]
<geist> kind of looking like it though  [03:52:07]
<TkTech> rofl  [03:52:08]
<TkTech> *shiver* cpumaster  [03:52:22]
<geist> 50cab3a6  [03:52:29]
<geist> actually, yeah that was gr00ber  [03:52:34]
<geist> fucker told me he wasn't going to do that agian  [03:52:42]
<geist> goddamn that pisses me off  [03:52:46]
<omegaman> ban?  [03:52:50]
<TkTech> ban hamma  [03:52:57]
<geist> doens't work on irc, you can always get around it  [03:52:58]
<geist> he thinks it's real funny to come in as different newbies and troll us
        for help  [03:53:20]
<TkTech> h  [03:53:39]
<geist> which i guess is kind of cute, but it really really pisses me off. I
        only have so much helpfulness in me  [03:53:46]
<geist> to use it up on that is just wrong
<geist> he'll go on for hours with it too  [03:54:24]
<zateam> lol, feeding the troll  [03:54:35]
<geist> multiple accounts at the same time, sometimes he even helps himself to
        try to lure others in  [03:54:36]
<geist> yeah, pretty much  [03:54:41]
<omegaman> weird  [03:54:47]
<omegaman> he used my nick (and others) the other day, so i am going to ask
           for a k-line  [03:54:59]
<TkTech> Nippon geist  [03:55:01]
<zateam> wow  [03:55:21]
<omegaman> hmm, a self-feeding troll  [03:55:28]
<zateam> that's pretty professional trolling heh  [03:55:31]
<cippo> omegaman: isn't there an option in nickserv to kick anyone that uses
        your nick within 30 secs if thye don't register?  [03:55:36]
<geist> yeah, well he's manic, so when he gets into one of his other phases
        he's not really controllable  [03:55:39]
<geist> yeah, pretty much  [03:55:40]
<omegaman> cippo, dunno, i'll check it out  [03:55:48]
<geist> omegaman: yeah if you register your nick you can kick others
                                                                     [03:56:02]
<omegaman> good to know  [03:56:21]
<TkTech> he'll have 5 minutes, then he'll be automaticly renamed  [03:56:25]
<TkTech> however, he can just leave, /nick <name again> and come back
                                                                     [03:56:40]
<geist> you can also use it to reclaim your own nick if you get a stalled
        connection  [03:56:48]
<nn> #ifdef NULL_POINTER_NOT_ZERO  [03:56:50]
<nn> Are there really OS with non-zero nulls?  [03:57:00]
<cippo> hmm, there's and option SET ENFORCE
<sbahra> nn, could you change your nickname to Samy for a second?  [03:57:04]
<nn> no  [03:57:11]
*** TkTech (n=chatzill@bas1-ottawa23-1167871338.dsl.bell.ca) is now known as
    Samy  [03:57:15]
<sbahra> Thanks  [03:57:22]
<zateam> s  [03:57:27]
<geist> haha  [03:57:44]
<geist> nn: i think c++ even went farther and defined 0 as null  [03:58:04]
<geist> or at least proclaimed it to be identical  [03:58:10]
*** TkTech (n=chatzill@bas1-ottawa23-1167871338.dsl.bell.ca) is now known as
    tktech  [03:58:12]
<sbahra> nn, yes. In C, it is not necessary for NULL to *really* be 0 (outside
         of C).  [03:58:25]
<tktech> Bastard, lol.  [03:58:28]
<nn> im looking over code thats been made too portable  [03:58:29]
<sbahra> nn, only in C it's required for NULL to be a zero value.  [03:58:35]
<geist> which means it's effectively 0, i guess  [03:58:55]
<Tk_Tech> did it work?  [03:58:57]
<tktech> Did what work.  [03:59:16]
<Tk_Tech> when i changed my nick to Samy?  [03:59:31]
<cippo> haha  [03:59:35]
<Tk_Tech> i didn't get back in  [03:59:36]
<tktech> Want to change your name back, or at least use a proxy so we all
         can't just compare your ip?  [04:00:22]
<zateam> so there isn't some hidden option to enable automatic nick switching
         on freenode for someone who doesn't identify i take it?  [04:01:06]
<Tk_Tech> good night  [04:01:16]
<nn> zateam: theres automatic kill  [04:01:22]
<nn> hang on  [04:01:25]
<cippo> zateam: SET ENFORCE claims to do automatic protection of nick
                                                                     [04:01:38]
<nn> set enforce on  [04:01:39]
<cippo> not sure how it works  [04:01:40]
<zateam> kk  [04:01:45]
<cippo> ops  [04:02:27]
<zateam> most nets with nickserv have that on by default. weird  [04:03:16]
<_Lucretia_> geist: seriously, I knew it gr00ber before his name was
             mentioned. There has to be some way of banning that retard for
             ever, surely?  [04:08:13]
<zateam> nope  [04:08:27]
<zateam> way too many ways to get new ips  [04:08:36]
<zateam> he has his own botnet too from what i've heard  [04:08:45]
<_Lucretia_> ah well  [04:08:48]
<_Lucretia_> botnet?  [04:08:53]
<geist> i normally catch it first, but i was lazy and didn't check the ip
        address  [04:08:58]
<_Lucretia_> I've got him on ignore, but only for his usual name  [04:09:14]
<omegaman> best strategy is to ignore him  [04:09:24]
<zateam> computers taken over by viruses and made to do things like spam
         websites or act as proxies  [04:09:26]
<zateam> ddos websites*  [04:09:33]
<geist> that's what i found with these things. you're almost better off just
        ignoring and not banning or whatnot
<apples`> i heard he can shoot lightning bolts from his hands !!  [04:09:34]
<zateam> that too  [04:09:39]
<geist> because as soon as you start the arms race of banning or whatnot, it
        gets impossible to ignore  [04:09:57]
<zateam> but this is from a troll friend who apparently had a troll to troll
         conversation with him  [04:10:04]
<geist> either via /ignore, or just because now you have to participate in
        their silly game  [04:10:10]
<geist> best way to comabt a troll is to really ignore them  [04:10:21]
<ManateeLazyCat>   [04:10:23]
<geist> like, just deal with it  [04:10:24]
<_Lucretia_> yeah  [04:10:27]
<omegaman> the nick list seems rather stable though, maybe register-only is
           the way to go?  [04:11:07]
<geist> no no  [04:11:15]
<omegaman> an annoyance, but better than a forum  [04:11:22]
<geist> need to make it friendly for anyone to come in  [04:11:27]
<_Lucretia_> then they get annoyed by him when first come here  [04:11:42]
<geist> if we can keep the gr00bers and mathis's in check, it's not a bad
        place for newbies to ask a question  [04:11:45]
<_Lucretia_> and dont come back  [04:11:46]
<zateam> it takes two seconds to reg a nick  [04:11:52]
<_Lucretia_> is Mathis one too?  [04:11:58]
<geist> gr00ber is mostly annoying to the old timers (me in particular)
                                                                     [04:12:02]
<omegaman> yeah
<_Lucretia_> just shows how much i stick my head in here :D  [04:12:08]
<zateam> it'll only discourage people who have nothing to do with the troll
                                                                     [04:12:12]
<geist> mathis is the one that really pisses off the newbies, since he just
        sits around and insults anyone that dares ask a question  [04:12:20]
* _Lucretia_ can't remember  [04:12:32]
<_Lucretia_> geist: maybe it's got something to do elitism associated with
             writing an os?  [04:14:09]
<geist> yeah, he's also just a massive asshole  [04:14:29]
<zateam> haha  [04:14:42]
* zateam looks at hostmask  [04:14:51]
<_Lucretia_> geist: that's a good un  [04:14:54]
<zateam> sees tor
<_Lucretia_> :P  [04:14:57]
<_Lucretia_> geist: like the goat.se picture? :D  [04:15:21]
<omegaman> the freenode ops regularily bans the entire tor network  [04:15:35]
<geist> my eyes, they burn!  [04:15:37]
* _Lucretia_ hands geist some cool water stuff  [04:15:56]
* _Lucretia_ thinks he'll have to order an arseburner of a curry to try to get
  rid of this cold  [04:16:24]
<eXeCuTeR> anyone here?  [04:16:42]
<geist> lots  [04:16:50]
<geist> we all float down here  [04:16:54]
<zateam> 74 people  [04:16:55]
<zateam> actually  [04:16:57]
<eXeCuTeR> oh that's coolswell, how you guys doing?  [04:17:11]
<geist> he was asking me questions in #newos, so i told him to come here
                                                                     [04:17:12]
<eXeCuTeR> yeah, well my question basically was: could you explain me the
           differences between real mode and protected mode and why should i
           enter protected mode if i wanted to write a kernel?  [04:17:31]
<_Lucretia_> geist: what you working on these days?  [04:17:40]
<omegaman> wasn't the trolling about this very topic?  [04:17:49]
* omegaman is dubious  [04:17:52]
<_Lucretia_> eXeCuTeR: well, the biggest + for protected is that you get a
             nice flat address space, but then if you've got a 64 it cpu,
             maybe going long would be better? who knows  [04:18:15]
<geist> _Lucretia_: hven't done much on newos in a few years, but i have a few
        other little os projects  [04:18:40]
<omegaman> long is protected mode too, and yeah, much nicer to work with
<eXeCuTeR> yep, i know, in protected mode a segment is 4GB long, while in real
           mode is 64KB  [04:18:44]
<geist> last thing i started screwing with last week was writing a ray tracer
                                                                     [04:18:54]
<_Lucretia_> nice  [04:19:02]
<eXeCuTeR> so why no one uses the protected mode for any program development?
                                                                     [04:19:19]
<geist> eXeCuTeR: plus the usual 32 > 16 thing  [04:19:21]
<_Lucretia_> omegaman: long is 64 bit though, with more registers (only took
             em 20 years!!!)  [04:19:26]
<geist> eXeCuTeR: *everyone* uses protected mode  [04:19:28]
<omegaman> _Lucretia_, yup  [04:19:36]
<_Lucretia_> omegaman: I missed off "to match the regs on a m68k!!")
                                                                     [04:19:56]
<geist> essentially anything that runs on x86s that isn't just DOS is all
        protected mode  [04:19:59]
<geist> linux, windows, etc  [04:20:02]
<eXeCuTeR> but there are certain things i've to do before i can enter the
           protected mode  [04:20:10]
<eXeCuTeR> the CR0, i have to change it to 1  [04:20:23]
<_Lucretia_> eXeCuTeR: if you use grub, it puts you there  [04:20:30]
<cippo> eXeCuTeR: use the GRUB to load your OS, it will drop you in pmode
                                                                     [04:20:34]
<zateam> ^^^  [04:21:16]
<zateam> agreed  [04:21:17]
<eXeCuTeR> my debian has recently crashed so grub is all screwed, and only
           windows is booting normallysam i on protected mode anyways?
                                                                     [04:21:18]
<eXeCuTeR> i must say, you guys are great, sorry for all of these questions
                                                                     [04:21:44]
<omegaman> or another multiboot booter  [04:22:09]
<cippo> so, where are you from eXeCuTeR ?  [04:23:03]
<eXeCuTeR> israel :)  [04:23:18]
<eXeCuTeR> you?  [04:23:21]
<eXeCuTeR> probably american  [04:23:31]
<cippo> ah, you probably have it warm and cosy then, i'm up in the cold north
                                                                     [04:23:39]
<cippo> norway to be precise  [04:23:45]
<eXeCuTeR> oh yeah, heh :)  [04:24:00]
<inflater_> fck lol  [04:24:05]
<inflater_> something happened xD going off  [04:24:12]
<eXeCuTeR> so anyways guys  [04:24:21]
<eXeCuTeR> does windows also drop you to the pmode  [04:24:29]
<omegaman> sure does :)  [04:24:42]
<eXeCuTeR> oh  [04:24:48]
<eXeCuTeR> alrightsthat's cool  [04:24:58]
<tktech> OH HELL  [04:25:37]
<geist> like i said, anything remotely recent is all protected mode  [04:25:40]
<geist> windows, linux, *bsd, etc  [04:25:41]
<geist> essentially until you enable protected mode you're an 8086
<geist> ie, a 30 year old cpu
<tktech> I work in 10 minutes  [04:25:42]
<tktech> later  [04:25:44]
<eXeCuTeR> the gdt is the global descriptor table that has different kind of
           information about different segments, right?  [04:27:18]
<geist> right  [04:27:25]
* xlq has just caught up with scrollback  [04:27:41]
<geist> btw, if you happen to be gr00ber, so help me i'll reach through the
        internet and kill you  [04:27:49]
<xlq> what? I was only reading scrollback.  [04:28:03]
<geist> no, eXeCuTeR   [04:28:16]
<xlq> oh.  [04:28:36]
<eXeCuTeR> what is it then?  [04:29:09]
<eXeCuTeR> i thought it holds information about segments  [04:29:20]
<geist> what is what?
<geist> yes  [04:29:23]
<geist> that's what i said  [04:29:28]
<geist> i agreeed with your statement  [04:29:37]
<eXeCuTeR> alrights(in you previous message you said no, that's what made me
           wonder)  [04:30:05]
<xlq> that was to me  [04:30:27]
<eXeCuTeR> alright  [04:30:36]
<xlq> hi gr00ber  [04:33:23]
<eXeCuTeR> and btw, i have never understood what paging is  [04:35:02]
<eXeCuTeR> argh im annoyying O_O  [04:35:14]
<geist> you will need to  [04:35:21]
<ronny__> yo  [04:35:26]
<ronny__> does anyone mind if i stab it?  [04:35:35]
*** ronny__ (n=ronny@ronny.uberhost.de) is now known as ronny  [04:35:40]
<geist> innocent until proven guilty  [04:36:09]
<geist> when we start thinking that all newcomers are gr00ber, gr00ber has won
                                                                     [04:37:32]
<_Lucretia_> omegaman: are there any other multiboot loaders?  [04:39:08]
<eXeCuTeR> lilo  [04:39:22]
<eXeCuTeR> for example  [04:39:25]
<omegaman> no  [04:39:29]
<omegaman> lilo is not MB  [04:39:31]
<eXeCuTeR> what's MB?  [04:39:36]
<omegaman> _Lucretia_, MBLOAD for one  [04:39:42]
<omegaman> eXeCuTeR, multiboot compliant  [04:39:47]
<nn> lilo == trash  [04:39:50]
<omegaman> _Lucretia_, maybe even Redboot is MB  [04:39:58]
<nn> was useful in its day
<nn> but its highly deprecated nowadays  [04:40:04]
<eXeCuTeR> what does it mean?  [04:40:06]
<omegaman> there are some other minor ones i think  [04:40:08]
<omegaman> eXeCuTeR, it's sort of a standard for how to boot an OS  [04:40:18]
<eXeCuTeR> i know how actually  [04:40:30]
<_Lucretia_> omegaman: yeah but redboot aint for peecee's tho is it?
<omegaman> i.e. the OS sets up a structure that any multiboot compliant loader
           will grok  [04:40:38]
<omegaman> _Lucretia_, embedded  [04:40:45]
<omegaman> MBLOAD is for peecees  [04:40:51]
<omegaman> though it's weird, since you boot via DOS  [04:41:01]
<eXeCuTeR> you write to the boot sector a binary image, 512 bytes big with the
           signature of 0xAA55 and load the os from there  [04:41:04]
<_Lucretia_> omegaman: well yeah, not peecee
<omegaman> but can be useful for testing  [04:41:06]
<_Lucretia_> omegaman: got an url for mbload, google brings up buffin
                                                                     [04:41:16]
<_Lucretia_> nuffin  [04:41:18]
<omegaman> _Lucretia_, i don't target peecee only  [04:41:19]
<_Lucretia_> fairy nuff  [04:41:26]
<omegaman> dunno, have it on my dev machine since years ago  [04:41:37]
<_Lucretia_> got it  [04:41:54]
<omegaman> referred to from here at least:
           http://my.execpc.com/~geezer/code/index.txt  [04:42:03]
<_Lucretia_> didn't know it was geist's (I think that's him)  [04:42:09]
<omegaman> i think gieser wrote it  [04:42:26]
<omegaman> _Lucretia_, it's not  [04:42:28]
<_Lucretia_> the one on the wiki is a dead link :( looking at that one
                                                                     [04:42:29]
<_Lucretia_> ah, thought chris giese was geist  [04:42:55]
<omegaman> heh  [04:43:02]
<ronny> eXeCuTeR: bios bootsectors are NOT MB  [04:43:19]
<eXeCuTeR> but lilo is a multiboot compliant also  [04:43:54]
<omegaman> and there really isn't such a thing as bios boot sectors :)
                                                                     [04:43:57]
<omegaman> eXeCuTeR, no  [04:44:06]
<eXeCuTeR> why not? the bios reads from the sectors  [04:44:21]
<_Lucretia_> eXeCuTeR: pc's are archaic pieces of shit, multiboot is a way
             around some problems with peecees
<omegaman> it can boot multiple os's, but not according to the MB spec
                                                                     [04:44:32]
<_Lucretia_> eXeCuTeR: lilo is not multiboot compliant  [04:44:45]
<omegaman> eXeCuTeR, http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/multiboot/
                                                                     [04:44:50]
<omegaman> that spec  [04:44:54]
<_Lucretia_> geist: you sure he's not groober?  [04:44:55]
<eXeCuTeR> how old are you guys? you seem to have a very wide knowledge
                                                                     [04:45:16]
<geist> pretty sure. he at least traces back to where he claims to be from
                                                                     [04:45:21]
<_Lucretia_> :D  [04:45:27]
<alexholowczak> lol  [04:45:29]
<ronny> omegaman: im not exactly sure how the heck to make it understandable
        to an entirely unknowing person  [04:45:39]
<omegaman> geist, can't a proxy fix that?
<_Lucretia_> eXeCuTeR: I've not actually written an os yet, just a few hello
             world (or bare bones) kernels  [04:45:50]
<omegaman> ronny, good points just nitpicking :)  [04:45:51]
<xlq> I can't even trace to him, lol  [04:45:53]
<_Lucretia_> eXeCuTeR: In Ada :D  [04:45:54]
<eXeCuTeR> the only thing that i've written which is close to an operating
           systems was this:  [04:46:35]
<eXeCuTeR> http://pastebin.com/m61418765  [04:47:05]
<nn> multiboot is a specification of the state the machine will be in and how
     a kernel is passed information gathered while the loader is still in real
     mode  [04:47:06]
* geist shrugs  [04:47:18]
<geist> i dont care. see the more we suspect everyone the more gr00ber wins
                                                                     [04:47:29]
<nn> i been spnding hours debugging this issue and it turns out to be far more
     complicated than it seems  [04:47:48]
<ronny> geist: i dont actually care if it is gr00ber, it acts anoyingly stupid
        - i wana stab  [04:48:11]
<cippo> bad day ronny ?  [04:48:26]
<nn> configuration file must be loaded to set the tuning hints on the block
     heap allocator, but listeners are dependant on the block heap allocator
     as they use sockets and the config defines the listeners :\  [04:48:30]
* _Lucretia_ hands ronny a peace pipe  [04:48:31]
<ronny> _Lucretia_: with weed?  [04:48:48]
<_Lucretia_> crack if ya want  [04:48:55]
<_Lucretia_> mebbe some meth  [04:49:02]
<ronny> no crack and meth for me  [04:49:07]
<_Lucretia_> ronny: pour some o dis in ya pipe and smoke it:
             http://www.healthinajiffy.co.uk/images/meths.jpg  [04:49:38]
<_Lucretia_> bbiab  [04:49:47]
<ronny> im all in for nice drugs every once in a while and i avoid all the
        massive dammage things like a pest  [04:49:57]
<nn> so time to rewrite the conf parser to be two-stage. First stage parses
     the dconf stuff, second parses the list stuffi meh  [04:50:00]
<eXeCuTeR> hey, do you guys have any recommendations to any kind of books on
           operating systems?  [04:50:03]
<ronny> meh, i never had any books on osdev  [04:50:48]
<xlq> Anyone's os project under Git? Dunno why, I've suddenly developed a
      fetish for Git.  [04:51:14]
<ronny> but i suspect taocp 1-4 will be a nice reading  [04:51:25]
<ronny> xlq: how the heck did you manage that much of mess ;P  [04:51:42]
<ronny> i developed a extended hate for git when i tried to interface it
                                                                     [04:52:15]
<xlq> lol
<xlq> really? Interesting.  [04:52:24]
<xlq> Tell me more!  [04:52:28]
<xlq> Convince me to hate Git again!  [04:52:40]
<ronny> the documentation sucks for anything thats not an everyday command
                                                                     [04:52:51]
<eXeCuTeR> any of you guys have an msn account?  [04:52:57]
* alexholowczak sings a Grease song thanks to xlq.  [04:52:58]
<ronny> and the commands for interfacing with it from scripts are a huge pain
                                                                     [04:53:17]
<xlq> hmm.  [04:53:38]
<ronny> hmm, i wonder why people develop this retarded longing for msn
        accounts  [04:53:52]
<apples`> because irc is tiring, duh  [04:54:09]
<xlq> I gave up MSN and Windows a long time ago, along with drugs and alcohol.
                                                                     [04:54:10]
<eXeCuTeR> hehe  [04:54:23]
<eXeCuTeR> but you still have clients in linux  [04:54:33]
<nn> Ahh simple enough fix, just add another if to the already if heavy
     config_load() and then call it with 0 for dictionary config (key=value)
     or 1 for list based, that way i can load the tuning stuff (key=value)
     then setup block heap allocator and list manager then finally load the
     list shit *meh*  [04:54:43]
<eXeCuTeR> like pidgin  [04:54:46]
* alexholowczak uses Pidgin.  [04:54:53]
<ronny> eXeCuTeR: doesnt mean anyone in their sane mind would sing up for msn
                                                                     [04:55:04]
<alexholowczak> I like Pidgin. So much metter than MSN as a Messenger client.
                                                                     [04:55:15]
<xlq> MSN is the network.  [04:55:25]
* zateam_ uses pidgin too  [04:55:29]
<alexholowczak> You know what I mean, xlq. :-P  [04:55:36]
<xlq> I used bitlbee for a while, but dropped it completely since everyone I
      know uses IRC now ;)  [04:55:41]
<nn> msn and pidgin both annoy me  [04:55:45]
<eXeCuTeR> i was just asking heh  [04:55:53]
<alexholowczak> xlq: All three of us? :-P  [04:55:54]
<ronny> i generaly prefer jabber  [04:56:03]
<zateam_> alexholowczak, ouch :P  [04:56:19]
<ronny> but its not that easy to convince non-tech friends to jabber
                                                                     [04:56:26]
<zateam_> none of my friends osdev  [04:56:33]
<zateam_> which is sad  [04:56:34]
<xlq> Also I didn't fancy all my conversations going straight through
      Microsoft's servers all the time.  [04:56:42]
<zateam_> none of them program eithers  [04:56:52]
<eXeCuTeR> could any one explain me what's paging? i've always failed to
           understand
<alexholowczak> zateam_: I can say that because I know him in real life. :-P
                                                                     [04:56:57]
<zateam_> i figured  [04:57:04]
*** zateam_ (i=blah@r45h88.res.gatech.edu) is now known as zateam  [04:57:10]
<alexholowczak> :-)  [04:57:17]

<banisterfiend> erlang's getting pretty big, writing an ircd would be a perfect excuse to learn it  [13:42:34]
<MT`AwAy> tktech> it helped me a lot in implementing those, while it's useless if you don't understand what you are doing, it fills the gap between
          theory and code  [13:47:28]
<tktech> yeah, just trying to think of something functional I'd write that would justify using it  [13:52:09]
<tktech> lol  [13:52:11]

<ronny> this is irc, if nothing is up, shut the fuck up and let us idle  [21:42:15]
<eXeCuTeR> people can get so nice sometimes, that's amazing  [21:42:47]
<xlq> what?  [21:43:14]
<xlq> O_o  [21:43:17]
<tktech> rofl  [21:49:36]
<eXeCuTeR> The A20 Address Line is the physical representation of the 20th bit of any memory access. what does this mean?  [21:51:03]
<eXeCuTeR> (im expecting a harsh comment)  [21:51:22]
<tktech> It does exactly what it says.  [21:51:59]
<eXeCuTeR> could you explain it to me in more simple words? my english is not very good  [21:52:51]
<tktech> Whats your native language.  [21:55:38]
<eXeCuTeR> hebrew  [21:55:54]
<eXeCuTeR> would ya?  [21:57:06]
<Gilgamesh> eXeCuTeR: it simply enables you to use 20 bit memory addresses  [22:19:35]
<Gilgamesh> means that then you can access up to 1mb of memory  [22:19:45]
<eXeCuTeR> what does 20bit memory addresses mean exactly?  [22:26:49]
<tantrika> illiterate executer, you need to learn about memory addressing, do this while learning computer architecture, next learn assembler  [22:28:42]
* xlq waves  [22:28:58]
<tantrika> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_memory  [22:29:58]
<eXeCuTeR> smart tantrika, you are so kind1  [22:33:13]
<tantrika> you need to be in #asm not #osdev  [22:33:29]
<eXeCuTeR> tantrika you are so smart and cool!  [22:34:07]
<eXeCuTeR> !give community anyop  [22:35:03]
<eXeCuTeR> how old are you btw? just curious  [22:36:22]
<tantrika> more than twice your age  [22:36:40]
<Gilgamesh> now that is what i call a cool number haha  [22:37:35]
<eXeCuTeR> i usually expect adults to be more respectful and nice than your behaviour  [22:37:48]
<tantrika> well lower your expectations idiot child  [22:38:03]
<Gilgamesh> myage + (2*myage+rand(1,50)) = yourage  [22:38:09]
<tantrika> this room is for os developers, not illiterate children trying to learn how computers work  [22:38:59]
<tantrika> #cartoons might be more appropriate  [22:39:48]
<Gilgamesh> after all, none of those os developers were ever a "child" trying to learn how computers work :)  [22:39:53]
<eXeCuTeR> yeah, they were all born geniouses like tantrika  [22:40:08]
<eXeCuTeR> Gilgamesh, where are you from?  [22:43:40]
<Gilgamesh> brazil  [22:43:51]
<eXeCuTeR> how old are you?  [22:43:57]
<Gilgamesh> 22  [22:44:23]
<ronny> learning is something you dont try, you do it  [22:44:32]
<ronny> bbl  [22:44:43]
<Gilgamesh> in order to do you gotta try :)  [22:45:14]
