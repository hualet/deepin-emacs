                           A Test Suite HaRe          

This directory contains some test cases for the refactorings developed in HaRe.

For each refactoring, there is a sub-directory which contains all the test casesfor this refactorings. For example, the sun-directory for the 'renaming' refactoring is '/testing/renaming'.

-- How to run the test suite? 

Suppose you are currently at the 'testing' directory,  

a. To run the whole test suite, type the following:
    
   ./UTest.sh 

b: To run the test cases for a specific refactoring, say renaming:

   cd renaming
   ./UTest.sh

-- How to see the testing result?

a: The screen output tells you how many test cases have been run, and how many
succeeded and how many failed. If a test case fails, you can go to the corresponding sub-directory and browse the 'log.txt' file for more detailed information.


-- How to read the test cases?

The orgnization of the test cases is specificed in the file 'UTest.data' in eachsub-directory refactoring. For example, the 'UTest.data' file in the 
'renaming' directory is like this:

where, 'positive' contains a list of test cases on which the specified refactoring should succeed, whereas 'negative' contains a list of test cases on which 
the specified refactoring should fail due to reasons such as the condition for
the refactoring is not satisfied.

Each item in the list specified the interface for a specific test case. For example,
the first item in the 'positive' is:

    (["D1.hs","B1.hs","C1.hs","A1.hs"],["AnotherTree", "6", "6"]),

which means the refactoring should rename the identifier at the location (line= 6, coluun=6 ) in the file "D1.hs" to a new name 'AnotherTree', and this refactoring will affect
the files: D1.hs , B1.hs, A1.hs.   
 
For this refactoring, the source file before the refactoring are D1.hs , B1.hs and A1.hs.
For the expected result for this refactoring:

The files containing the program source from the token stream are: D1_TokOut.hs B1_TokOut.hs and A1_TokOut.hs.

The files containing the program source from the AST are: D1_AstOut.hs, B1_AstOut.hs andA1_AstOut.hs.
